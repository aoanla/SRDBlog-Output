<p>The ground-rules for the Awards are covered in the launch post <a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/11/srdbawards-nom-2019/">here</a> .</p>
<p>The hub for all links to categories is <a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/12/srdbawards-hub-2019/">here</a> .</p>
<p>As mentioned in that link, voting is by <em>approval voting</em>.
This means that you can, and should, tick boxes for all of the nominees you think would deserve to win. You can tick all the boxes, if you think they're all deserving; you can tick no boxes if you think none are deserving.</p>
<p>Everyone gets <em>a single submission</em> (with as many boxes ticked as they want); we have enabled detection of multiple submissions on this form, and will also be taking action against unusual voting patterns which get past this.</p>

<h3>Nominee: Graeme McPhail (Bairn City Rollers)</h3>
<p>"Graeme has been coaching us (Fresh Meat) and has been absolutely amazing! I've gone from being not very confident with my skating and derby skills at all, to now being so close to passing my mins, and it's all thanks to Graeme!
Graeme doesn't just focus on skating skills to pass mins, he really does show us how to use our skills in derby scenarios so we will be more ready to play once we pass! Well, that's the theory anyway, haha! "</p>
