<p>The ground-rules for the Awards are covered in the launch post <a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/11/srdbawards-nom-2019/">here</a> .</p>
<p>The hub for all links to categories is <a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/12/srdbawards-hub-2019/">here</a> .</p>
<p>As mentioned in that link, voting is by <em>approval voting</em>.
This means that you can, and should, tick boxes for all of the nominees you think would deserve to win. You can tick all the boxes, if you think they're all deserving; you can tick no boxes if you think none are deserving.</p>
<p>Everyone gets <em>a single submission</em> (with as many boxes ticked as they want); we have enabled detection of multiple submissions on this form, and will also be taking action against unusual voting patterns which get past this.</p>

<div class="section" id="nominee-batmags-retired">
<h3>Nominee: Batmags (retired)</h3>

</div>
<div class="section" id="nominee-candy-moho-glasgow-roller-derby">
<h3>Nominee: Candy Moho (Glasgow Roller Derby)</h3>
<p>"For all of the behind the scenes work that Candy does, whether in UKRDA or within the Scottish Derby Community, scheduling work, helping staffing games and just being such a helpful source of information and lovely person."</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="nominee-dinoosawruss-hereford-poison-berries">
<h3>Nominee: Dinoosawruss (Hereford Poison Berries)</h3>

<div class="section" id="nominee-shuggs-bunny-dundee-roller-derby-power-of-scotland">
<h3>Nominee: Shuggs Bunny (Dundee Roller Derby / Power of Scotland)</h3>
<p>"#WheresShuggs - everywhere
Continually focusing on the development of officials all across Scotland, working on mini-boot camps (DRD's Hang and Chats) with the focus of extending the knowledge to other leagues and newer officials. Always supporting folk to try their hand at officiating and giving a safe space to do so. Has stepped up to represent the Scottish scene at every level and flourished, [due to] his constant drive to improve his own reffing within training (on track and off)."</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="nominee-skabarella-manchester-roller-derby">
<h3>Nominee: Skabarella (Manchester Roller Derby)</h3>

<h3>Nominee: Skiritai (OH Roller Derby, Korea)</h3>
<p>"He is our lone referee, doing the work of many, and always putting his whole heart into the sport and our team. He is at every practice he can be, even with his crazy military work schedule, and always takes the time to explain/show things at practice to help everyone be better."</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="nominee-sparks-mae-fly">
<h3>Nominee: Sparks Mae Fly</h3>
<p>"Even though he had a break this year, Sparks managed to CHR or THR a number of UK and European tournaments, bringing his knowledge and a ton of fun to tracks everywhere. I have found him to be the most kind, knowledgeable, thoughtful and supportive referee who has helped me every time and in every way he can."</p>
