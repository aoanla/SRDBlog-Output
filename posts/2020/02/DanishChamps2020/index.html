<p><strong>How long have you been planning this, and how hard was it to get all the leagues involved?</strong></p>
<p>I pitched the idea of af Danish Championship to Aalborg Roller Derbys board in February 2019. I said if they would let me do it I would take care of almost all the planning. Fortunately they said yes. The next step was to contact the Sportskomitte (1 representation of every league in Denmark is in this committee) to find a date that would suit all of the leagues.</p>
<p>Every league had to bring 1-5 volunteers to make the day run smoothly. The volunteers would be paired up with someone from another league in order to strengthen the relationships between the leagues. Volunteer work was Entrance and Track repair, and everything else would be handled by more volunteers from Aalborg Roller Derby.</p>
<p><strong>Why Roller Derby Sevens? (And would you keep Sevens for next time?)</strong></p>
<p>We are a small country, and only 3 out of our 6 leagues have enough players for the roster of a regular game. By doing it Sevens style, all leagues could join without having to find guest players, and thereby get the whole team experience. I have had feedback from some of the smaller leagues that really enjoyed this set up because they could be a team.</p>
<p>Also by doing it Sevens style we could do it in one day, making room for social dinner and afterparty in the evening.</p>
<p>Aalborg Roller derby also invited all Danish skaters and officials to a bootcamp the next day. We came up with the idea because we wanted to include even more of the derby people than just the ones getting to play or officiate the championship and it was a huge success with a lot of participants.</p>
<p>[Bootcamp: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1185401364986503/">https://www.facebook.com/events/1185401364986503/</a> ]</p>
<p><strong>What does it mean to Denmark, or you, or Aalborg, to have their own National Championships?</strong></p>
<p>Denmark: for roller derby in Denmark it has a positive impact. By having a championship we get taken more serious as a sport. It also is a great way to get a lot of media coverage of the sport and hopefully make people aware that there is roller derby in Denmark and that there is a league close to them.</p>
<p>Us: For is it means a lot to have the National Championship. As the hosts we had to come together and work hard to set this up. Fortunately we could use our experiences from hosting our annual tournament The Northern Takedown (TNT) so we only had to adjust our planning to fit into the 7’s format and then follow our work instructions from TNT.</p>
<p>To play in the championship gave us a great goal to aim for, which was to bring home the gold. We worked really hard at every practice and everyone committed 100% to make this happen.</p>
<p>In January we had the pleasure of getting coached by Miracle whips and we evolved our game by adding what we had just learned to our existing mindset and strategies.</p>
<p>Everything came together and we reached our main goal.</p>
<p>Aalborg: We have had a lot of PR on this including local radio host joining our practice. We hope that by hosting the championship it will make the citizens of Aalborg more aware of what roller derby can do for them. They can either get a fun action packed day by watching our games or get the full experience of hard physical work, challenge their minds with the strategies, have the greatest friends and the feeling of community if they join our league.</p>
<p><strong>What was attendance like?</strong></p>
<p>It was great. We had a lot of officials, skaters volunteers, medics and vendors and we had 100+ spectators.</p>
<p><strong>Did you get much media interest? (Did you consider a livestream, and did you know that WFTDA.tv would probably have been interested?)</strong></p>
<p>As previously mentioned we had some local radio hosts joining our practice and one of our skaters afterwards joined the radio show. Some articles were written and two days after the championship we got contacted by a television show.</p>
<p>We talked about streaming but unfortunately we didn’t have the number of volunteers to make it happen. We didn’t know that WFTDA.tv might have been interested but we will keep that in mind for the future.</p>
