<h2>Central and South America Regional Rep: Maki</h2>
<img alt="Photograph of Makie Antoinette" src="../../../../images/2019/11/MakieAntoinette.jpg"><p>Makie Antoinette — she/her</p>
<p>Sailor City Rollers Head Official</p>
<p>WFTDA Regional Trainer — Latin America</p>
<p><strong>Tell us a bit about yourself...</strong></p>
<p>Hey there, I'm Maki which is short for Makie Antoinette which is my derby alter ego for my real name, Macarena (Yes, like the song. Yes, I've done the dance countless times). I've been around the derby multiverse for about 7 years now, which is more than half of the time the sport has existed in my country, Argentina. Currently I'm on my 6th year as a full time non skating official and on my 4th as Sailor City Rollers Head Official.</p>
<p>My current tasks in derby go from being Head Official in my league, working with WFTDA's Official Education Committee as a Regional Trainer for Latin America and going around tournaments with a very distinctive glittery pink crown.</p>
<p>When not doing derby I'm a social worker in the making, history nerd to an unnecessary level and proud mom of a 5 year old tabby cat called Dorian.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you apply as a Regional Rep for the RDNC?</strong></p>
<p>The nomination came to me as a surprise from a Latin American team located in Uruguay.</p>
<p>I had previously seen the ballot opening in the page, but hesitated to apply to it since I did not know I'd make the cut or had the necessary qualifications for the task. This team's vote of trust on me pushed me to believe that I was up to the task and I'm thankful they did. Being a representative for LatAm is not only a huge responsability but a honor and I can't wait to work together with the Committee to make stuff happen for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>What are your hopes and plans for the Roller Derby Nations Committee?</strong></p>
<p>Coming into the table with my fellow regional chairs, my hope is to bring into the discussion an insight on emerging nations and geographically isolated regions in a way that we can work out a system that everyone can benefit for— no matter the country where you're located.</p>
<p>Great talents are arising in the non central regions and it's up to us to create spaces where they are heard, considered and granted the space they so heavily need and deserve.</p>
<p>In the times that we are living it's on us to create a community where all the Nations come together and WFTDA's motto is key: real, strong, athletic, revolutionary and most of all, diverse.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and have a great day ✨</p>
