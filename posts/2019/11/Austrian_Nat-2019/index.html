<p>Most of the National Tournaments we cover have been running for many years, but as Roller derby expands across the world, we see newer tournaments establishing themselves in additional Nations.
One such newer tournament is the <strong>Austrian Championship</strong>, running for only its second year in 2019.</p>
<p>We talked to 2019 hosts, the Fearless Bruisers of Roller Derby Innsbruck about the tournament, and how it is already growing.</p>
<p>Austria has had Roller Derby for some time, with Vienna Roller Derby having been playing since 2011, including internationally. However, for much of that time, they were literally the only league in the country, with most of their bouts played across the borders in Switzerland or Germany (or further afield in Europe). It was only in 2015 that additional teams were founded, in Linz, followed in 2017 by Graz and Innsbruck, and most recently in Salzburg in 2018. In 2020, we expect to see even more leagues form, as the trend of Roller Derby in Central and Eastern Europe continues to point upward.</p>
<img alt="" src="../../../../images/2019/11/Austria2019.png"><p>The first Austrian Championship, last year, featured all of these teams except Salzburg's Knockouts, who were not yet able to compete at the time. This time around, however, all 5 Austrian leagues are sending teams, to compete in what will be a two-day round-robin tournament.</p>
<hr class="docutils">
<p>"We're very happy to host the 3rd edition of the Ã–M in our hometown and feel lucky that we managed to find enough officials, announcers, helping hands etc. to manage this. Luckily, we were also able to raise some public funding for the tournament which makes everything a lot easier. Nonetheless there are so many aspects to think about that we are all pretty busy in our free time right now - but this is nothing new for everyone who is into Roller Derby I guess ðŸ˜‰ still, we have never hosted a 2-days tournament and are very much looking forward to have a full Roller Derby weekend at home.
Something new: weâ€™ll have a halftime show! Our recently founded cheerleaders will set up something for us"</p>
