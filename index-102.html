<p>Last year, we ran a series of "<a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/categories/road-to-playoffs/">Road To Playoffs</a>" posts, providing an alternative view of the WFTDA Rankings as a way to predict which teams are likely to make Playoffs. We're happy with how this went, so we're going ahead with the same plan this year...</p>
<p>Speedy Convalesce, one of the two primary Derby Scoreboard Developers, and founder of the Star Track "league without skaters" in Germany, has recalculated the <a class="reference external" href="https://stats.wftda.com/rankings?r=2986">ratings</a> for every team in WFTDA - as if their rating was calculated at <strong>June 30th 2020</strong> [the ranking which will be used to decide Qualifications and seedings into both WFTDA Playoffs, and the Continental Cups].. (Aficionados of the WFTDA rating will know that it applies a "decay factor" to older games, which is what we're tweaking here.) This helps to give a feel for how important the games each team has played in the season are, so far.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Whilst we can't predict the future, this will give the best guess of what teams need to do to qualify, based on what they've already done. This means that this will be the penultimate edition of the Road to Playoffs series.</p>
<p>As well as attaining a minimum ranking, teams also need to play at least 4 bouts within the eligibility period (December 2019 to June 2029), and we'll be tracking their progress on this measure, too.</p>

<p>There's always exciting Roller Derby firsts, and international match ups every year in the calendar, and we can usually argue about just which event was the highlight of the year.</p>
<p>In 2020, though, we already have a very strong candidate, as Egypt's <a class="reference external" href="https://cairollers.com">CaiRollers</a> and South Africa's <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goldencityrollers.com/">Golden City Rollers</a> make history with the first every intra-African Roller Derby tournament.</p>
<p>As we've written about <a class="reference external" href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/06/rollerderby-za-2019/">previously</a>, South African roller derby exists in its own geographical bubble, far from other nations; but the CaiRollers have had almost as much trouble finding regular opponents (despite being just across the Mediterranean from Greece, and not that far from Italy and Austria). After making history with the first MENA game (against Abu Dhabi Roller Derby in January 2017), and playing Marseille's Bloody Skulls in mid 2017, the CaiRollers have had no other international opponents.</p>
<img alt="The 'A Frican Good Time' Flyer, large text of the event name in block capitals over diagonally divided field of red (top left) and gold (bottom right). Red part of field has subtle ancient Egyptian hieroglyph pattern, gold part of field has subtle Zulu-style geometric patterning. To the left of the text is a jammer, whose flesh is invisible, but whose clothing and kit are red, black and gold." src="images/2020/03/africangoodtimeflyer.jpg"><p>So, since October 2018, they've been planning something more audacious: raising funds to travel themselves, down to Johannesburg. Readers will remember their <a class="reference external" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cairollers-to-south-africa/#">Indiegogo</a> fundraiser, which did not reach its target, to achieve this by 2019... but the funds that were raised there have been the basis of further money-raising within Cairo itself. Profits from local events, including a recent home teams game at the start of February, have all been funnelled into the venture, and individual skaters have spent personal funds on making their flight bookings. This will be the CaiRollers' first ever away bout, and it's a huge step to make in addition to the usual issues that come with playing away!</p>
<p>This has always been a collaborative effort between Golden City Rollers and the CaiRollers, but as GCR told us, it's grown since the initial plan of just a single game:</p>
<blockquote>
"CaiRollers first contacted us with the idea for this event in October 2018, and we have literally been counting the days since! Last year, GCR and CaiRollers decided to run a tournament instead of just one game and we invited other South African leagues to participate. With travel costs being a challenge, Durban Roller Derby and Cape Town Rollergirls opted to form a mixed team, along with some players from UAE All Stars, where an ex-GCR-skater currently lives. They'll compete together as the Pan-African Rollers. It's been both challenging and exciting pulling together our first international tournament, but we've learned a lot along the way and we're hoping this will be the first of many more to come. Only days to go now...we can't wait to have all the teams here and on the track!"</blockquote>
<p>This also makes this the first year that South Africa will host two tournaments with teams from across their own country: normally this happens just the once, in their end-of-year Derbyfest. As with Derbyfest last year, this will be a three-teams round-robin, followed by a "finals" playoff for the top two teams from that stage.</p>
<p>The entire tournament will be streamed on the GCR <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChpT56bZ-6bgrZL1slDXNVA">YouTube</a> channel. (We'd keep an eye on GCR's <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/228775404810943/">Facebook</a> event page for more info.)</p>

<p>As Roller Derby grows across a country, inevitably people start thinking about having a National Tournament (usually around the time they think about needing a National Governing Body). So, whilst some Nationals - in, say Mexico or Sweden - have been running for a very long time - there's always new National tournaments forming.</p>
<p>On the 1st of February, Denmark held its first <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/764179684037734/">National Tournament</a> in 4 years, taking the unusual (worldwide) step of using the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rsdpDACXou9PL_wIZgPhZltHvF0ScWmlcyfhH6uWTC4/">Roller Derby Sevens</a> ruleset.
This tournament was the result of both conception and huge commitment by one person - <a class="reference external" href="https://aalborgrollerderby.dk/">Aalborg Roller Derby</a> 's Möxie Crüel, so we caught up with her to discuss the genesis of the tournament, it's aims and plans for the future.</p>
