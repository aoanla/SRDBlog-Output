&lt;p&gt;Highlights include footage from 2019's Battle of the Islands (Hawai'i's state tournament), discussion of future directions for derby in Hawai'i [and how it's developed over time], and some Team Indigenous news towards the end!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That first edition covered Italian Roller Derby - and we're back today with the second edition, featuring the Czech Roller Derby community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few days, a number of National Tournaments, and pseudo-National-Tournaments (like Australia's Great Southern Slam) have been postponing or cancelling their competitive seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest National Tournaments in the Roller Derby community, the Championnat de France and British Championships, announced their cancellation of the current competitive seasons on the 1st April and today, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of France, this was an easier decision to make slightly earlier - their competitive season runs from late-Autumn to early Summer, rather than within the same year, so the current pandemic restrictions cover almost all of their remaining season.
Their announcement was made via the MyRollerDerby Facebook account, here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/Myrollerderby/photos/a.877129749133391/1447453628767664/?type=3"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/Myrollerderby/photos/a.877129749133391/1447453628767664/?type=3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For British Champs, this will have been a more nuanced decision, as their season only started 2020, but it's clear that with the lost of months of competitive time, and the fact that inevitably, their competitors will be out of peak training (and potentially out of pocket) for some time after restrictions are loosened, it was the only reasonable decision.
(Two weeks ago, BC and UKRDA were actively working to try to salvage some of the season, but it is clearly impossible at this stage, due to the increasingly obvious duration of the disruption.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British Championships will restart in 2021, with a brand new season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement from British Champs can be found here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishchamps.com/2020/2020-season-announcement/"&gt;https://www.britishchamps.com/2020/2020-season-announcement/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Australia, the Great Southern Slam - the largest Roller Derby tournament in the world - is also being affected, as we mentioned above. Avoiding calling it a "cancellation", TGSS are instead "postponing" to 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement for TGSS's new date was made here (with the announcement of the original 2020 event not happening being a week previous):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the WFTDA announced that they were dramatically slimming down the "post-Season" for this year, and the effects continue today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last hour, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mrdwc.com"&gt;Men's Roller Derby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; announced that they had decided to take the sad step of cancelling the current date for the 2020 MRDWC in St Louis, in favour of a booking some time in 2021. As this is a postponement, we assume that the MRDWC 2021 will be in the same place, and hopefully will have the same teams... just in a different year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, with the near-global hiatus in team training, not to say opportunities for Officials to keep up their practice, no-one can say what Roller Derby will look like even in a year's time. Roller Derby is also sensitive to non-sport specific issues which affect all volunteer communities - the expected increase in unemployment, and other economic impacts, is likely to affect the sport worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the converse side, the extra time and delay may also allow some teams which dropped out of contention for the 2020 MRDWC time to regroup and reapply. MRDWC is being open about allowing such teams an opportunity to rejoin the competition for its 2021, if they wish to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full text of the MRDWC announcement is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have come to a decision. We will be postponing the St. Louis MRDWC indefinitely, with a target date of March/April 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our reasoning:
First, no one wants to cancel. We all want to skate. This is our best option for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, although the venue is perfect for our purposes, they cannot yet commit to a date. They will let us know in a few months, which is why we need to leave the date open for now. We may be able to announce the date before July, and indeed we hope so. Our host is working with the venue to make this happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that this offers you the ability to plan, to recover costs or move bookings, and to refocus on keeping yourselves and yours healthy and safe. The host hotel will cancel all bookings for this event in a few days for those who booked with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you all around the track...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, though, it's still a bit negative, as the WFTDA announced the cancellation of Playoffs and Continental Cups this season. With the ongoing effects of COVID-19 responses across all of the competitive regions in which Roller Derby happens, it was inevitable that the competitive season would be at least strongly truncated - with it unlikely that we'll see anything like a semblance of "normal training" before June, it's clear that expecting teams to launch back into the WFTDA Sanctioned competition would be unrealistic (to say nothing of the expectations this would place on Officials and Volunteers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As far as possible, the hosts will be hosting the equivalent events in 2021, with WFTDA support for the impacts of this on the leagues.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst the Rankings Committee and Competitive Play Committee have made continual adjustments to try to allow the rankings system to support teams, it's sometimes necessary to also cut back the schedule itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WFTDA &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; still planning a "Championships" event in November, although we would imagine that the nature of this will be strongly dependent on upcoming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full WFTDA statement can be found here:&lt;/p&gt;

With competitive Roller Derby on-pause, this presents a great opportunity to take stock and catch up with the state of the sport around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this vein, then, we're launching a new Vodcast series - hopefully a long-lived run of video chats with skaters around the world about derby in their country. As our opening episode, we caught up with 6 members of the Italian Roller Derby community to discuss the sport in their country, a new initiative for bringing the leagues together; and also to watch one of the 30-minute games from the 2018 Roller Derby World Cup - as Italy took on Team Indigenous!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can catch the Vodcast here, or on YouTube:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;and we'll be updating this with an audio-only version in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, whilst their tournament was one of the few not to be cancelled last weekend, events caught up with them rapidly, as the evolving pandemic led to many of the team having their flights back to Egypt cancelled. In addition, Egypt itself declared that it would soon be closing its borders, requiring other team members to rebook flights at short notice and considerable expense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an extremely stressful few days, we can confirm that all members of the CaiRollers have made it back to Cairo - some at the last moment, and many having to travel complex routes with changes in central Africa. However, all of this additional last-minute travel booking, and cancellation of other things planned in South Africa (with additional fees!), has cost the CaiRollers considerably. As well as the financial costs, they have also lost some of their kit enroute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, along with others like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://derbywithoutborders.org"&gt;Derby Without Borders&lt;/a&gt; , have been keeping in contact with the team to see how we can help them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you would like to help the CaiRollers, please donate funds to their PayPal account at fundraising@cairollers.com or contact Derby Without Borders who are also we believe helping to organise funds and support with replacement kit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>cairollers</category><category>covid19</category><category>egyptian roller derby</category><category>fundraising</category><category>international roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2020/03/CaiRollersNeed/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Mar 2020 15:40:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
