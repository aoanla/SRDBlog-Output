&lt;p&gt;In 2020, though, we already have a very strong candidate, as Egypt's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cairollers.com"&gt;CaiRollers&lt;/a&gt; and South Africa's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goldencityrollers.com/"&gt;Golden City Rollers&lt;/a&gt; make history with the first every intra-African Roller Derby tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we've written about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/06/rollerderby-za-2019/"&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt;, South African roller derby exists in its own geographical bubble, far from other nations; but the CaiRollers have had almost as much trouble finding regular opponents (despite being just across the Mediterranean from Greece, and not that far from Italy and Austria). After making history with the first MENA game (against Abu Dhabi Roller Derby in January 2017), and playing Marseille's Bloody Skulls in mid 2017, the CaiRollers have had no other international opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The 'A Frican Good Time' Flyer, large text of the event name in block capitals over diagonally divided field of red (top left) and gold (bottom right).

&lt;p&gt;So, since October 2018, they've been planning something more audacious: raising funds to travel themselves, down to Johannesburg. Readers will remember their &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cairollers-to-south-africa/#"&gt;Indiegogo&lt;/a&gt; fundraiser, which did not reach its target, to achieve this by 2019... but the funds that were raised there have been the basis of further money-raising within Cairo itself. Profits from local events, including a recent home teams game at the start of February, have all been funnelled into the venture, and individual skaters have spent personal funds on making their flight bookings. This will be the CaiRollers' first ever away bout, and it's a huge step to make in addition to the usual issues that come with playing away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has always been a collaborative effort between Golden City Rollers and the CaiRollers, but as GCR told us, it's grown since the initial plan of just a single game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"CaiRollers first contacted us with the idea for this event in October 2018, and we have literally been counting the days since! Last year, GCR and CaiRollers decided to run a tournament instead of just one game and we invited other South African leagues to participate. With travel costs being a challenge, Durban Roller Derby and Cape Town Rollergirls opted to form a mixed team, along with some players from UAE All Stars, where an ex-GCR-skater currently lives. They'll compete together as the Pan-African Rollers. It's been both challenging and exciting pulling together our first international tournament, but we've learned a lot along the way and we're hoping this will be the first of many more to come. Only days to go now...we can't wait to have all the teams here and on the track!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also makes this the first year that South Africa will host two tournaments with teams from across their own country: normally this happens just the once, in their end-of-year Derbyfest. As with Derbyfest last year, this will be a three-teams round-robin, followed by a "finals" playoff for the top two teams from that stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire tournament will be streamed on the GCR &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChpT56bZ-6bgrZL1slDXNVA"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; channel. (We'd keep an eye on GCR's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/228775404810943/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; event page for more info.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the public schedule, there will also be an all-day bootcamp on the Saturday, providing maximum benefit to all attending teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to bring you a longer article as a post-mortem on the whole event, in a few weeks' time, but for now: put a pin in this for your diary!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>a frican good time</category><category>cairollers</category><category>egyptian roller derby</category><category>emirates roller derby</category><category>golden city rollers</category><category>south african roller derby</category><category>uae roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2020/03/AfricanGoodTimePre/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2020 08:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Weekend Highlights: 23 Nov 2019</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/highlights/2019/weekendhighlights-23112019/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might think things would slow down in derby in late November, but this is still an exceptionally busy week, worldwide. There's multiple tournaments and international bouts: returning tournaments in Belgium, with Skate Around #3;  in Italy, with Scusa Mamma, Ma Sono Una Derby Girl; and in Argentina, with Juguemos Pué; in the UK, returing Roller Derby Sevens and Sur5al events; and continuing tournament series in Germany, France, and Japan (where Derby Nights 4x4's fixture is extra long due to the postponed bout in October).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention, and because it's quiet enough that we have the space. In this case, there's three Argentine events, because we really want to highlight how much exciting stuff is happening in Latin America right now.&lt;/p&gt;
