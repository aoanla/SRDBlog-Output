(As most of the events in Latin America are on Sunday, that means that the map for this update looks a bit unbalanced...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a bunch of things this &lt;em&gt;Thursday&lt;/em&gt; - mostly open scrimmages, in Aberdeen, Geneva, and Bundaberg (the latter is a "pot luck" game, so open to the public, but still open subs). On the weekend, Helsinki is celebrating 10 years of Roller Derby in Finland with a party; and Cologne are celebrating 10 years of derby in Köln with a two-day international tournament! (Blackpool are also celebrating 7 years with a party on Friday.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big national events are in Innsbruck, where the Fearless Bruisers host the third ever Austrian National Championship, and in Toulouse, where the Championnat de France Nationale 1 has a two-day fixture. (In Turku, there's a Suomi Cup fixture, but it's closed to the public.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;

In this case, the 2019 Mexican National Championships are in Querétaro, and the Brasilian Nationals are in Blumenau. (Plus, of course, this is the weekend of WFTDA's Championships). In addition, the ongoing Finnish and French tournament fixtures recur again this weekend...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... and there are big tournaments in Kiel, Regensburg, Cambridge, Wiltshire, and Buenos Aires!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[We'd also like to shout out the bout in Japan, for Yokosuka Sushi Rollers versus Kamikaze Badass, and also Tel Aviv Roller Derby's open scrim!]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is busy enough that we're going to have a second, short, Sunday-only update later in the week so we can fit more geographical range in here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Plus, more that we've not got space to summarise up here, and you'll have to read down for!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture

&lt;p&gt;Quite apart from those, there are also international events in Newcastle (as Newcastle Roller Girls celebrate 10 years), Vienna,  and Vicenza; Short Track Roller Derby and referee clinics in Buenos Aires; and a National Meeting of minds in Manizales, Colombia!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture

&lt;p&gt;We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention, and because it's quiet enough that we have the space.&lt;/p&gt;

And, to add to that, this is the weekend of the annual Big Blether Scottish Roller Derby Conference, so all the leagues will be coming together there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also two-day international tournaments in Sweden, the Mexican National Division 2 Championships in Léon, Sudestada Roller Derby's debut bout in Necochea, and more!&lt;/p&gt;

We have a double dose of action in Argentina, with Indias Roller Derby of Quilmes, and recently Continental Cup winners, Sailor City Rollers both hosting multi-bout events!

As well as a second WFTDA Playoffs showcasting Sweden, and giving the UK it's second chance at a Champs place, there's equally exciting action in the USA for Brussels Derby Pixies in California; the finals of Victoria's Statewide Stampede tournament in Australia; the start of Finland's Suomi Cup for 2019/2020... and much more!&lt;/p&gt;

The coming few days, as well as seeing the first of the WFTDA Playoffs (with attendees from) also see the first in a regular series of Short Track events in the UK, a a gaggle of bootcamps and clinics from the UK to Argentina, and even more tournaments.

&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're slightly breaking our usual rule this Sunday to allow two events for France. The French schedule of events is so dense, we end up overlooking many of them each weekend in only picking one, so we're selecting two equally important fixtures for this Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://roadkillrollers.nl/"&gt;Roadkill Rollers&lt;/a&gt; host their inaugural "Small Teams Tournament", a one-day event aimed at giving smaller teams more opportunities to play in a tournament environment. This is an 8 team tournament, organised as 2 groups of 4, into a final between the top team in each group (for a total of 13 games in the day). Each game is 20 minutes long, based on the schedule. The tournament is OTA, but not all teams are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teams (Group A)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market Gardeners (Eindhoven, Arnhem and Nijmegen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thunder &amp;amp; Lightning (Groningen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jammer Slammers (Arnhem??)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roller Derby Twente&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Group B)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roadkill Rollers (Nijmegen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keytown Roller Derby (Leiden-based exhibition team)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pink Peril Roller Derby (Limburg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blacksheep Honey Rollers (Middelburg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Games are not listed in FTS, as they are too short. (We'd still love to know the results, though)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event starts: 1200 Sunday (first game)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venue: Sporthal de Horstacker, Horstacker 1401, Nijmegen, Netherlands&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://rollerderbydunkerquois.fr/"&gt;Sirènes Hurlants&lt;/a&gt; of Dunkirk host a triple header of Roller Derby on the French coast, with two scrimmages (one MRDA-gender and one WFTDA-gender), and a full game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Les Sirènes Hurlantes (Dunkirk) versus Les Nasty Pêcheresses (Montreuil B)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MRDA-gender Open Scrimmage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WFTDA-gender rookie Open Scrimmage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FTS lists only the first game, as scrimmages cannot be rated&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event starts: 1100 Sunday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venue: Lycée de l'Europe, 809 Rue du Banc Vert, Dunkirk, France&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limoges' &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.limogesrollerskating.info/roller-derby/"&gt;Porcelain Dolls&lt;/a&gt; host a triple header of French roller derby for a less-than-quiet Sunday. This is a round-robin tournament between Limoges, Quads de Paris, and Toulouse!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rainbow Furies (Toulouse C) versus Porcelain Dolls (Limoges)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;La Carcasse (Quads de Paris C) versus Rainbow Furies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Porcelain Dolls versus La Carcasse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event starts: 1000 Sunday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venue: Gymnases Municipaux Beaubreuil Hau, 84 rue Rhin et Danube, Limoges, France&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.dollyrockitrollers.co.uk/"&gt;Leicestershire Dolly Rockit Rollers&lt;/a&gt; are also helping to give people more games, with their "Love at First Fight", a WFTDA-gender policy rookie &amp;amp; intermediate tournament.
This is a three-team round-robin tournament with teams mixed up from the skaters signed up, with the three 30 minute games ending in a 40-minute final (presumably a rematch between the two highest ranked teams).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event starts: 1200 Sunday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venue: Loughborough Leisure Centre, Browns Lane, Loughborough, UK&lt;/p&gt;

(This is necessary to enable the proper support of Roller Derby in this area of Argentina, where, as you can see, there's a lot of teams already!). This first edition is hosted by Atlántico Sur in Miramar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event starts: 1700 Sunday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venue: Club Defensores, Miramar, Argentina&lt;/p&gt;
