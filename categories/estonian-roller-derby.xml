&lt;p&gt;We're back today with the fourth edition, featuring the Roller Derby community in the Baltic States (Latvia and Estonia) and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlights include footage from 2019's Fab Slav (the 3rd Baltic/Slavic Roller Derby Sevens tournament, hosted by Warsaw Roller Derby), an extended discussion of Short Track Roller Derby, and a conversation about the best skate shop in Riga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to technical issues (the laptop we use for the video call bluescreened in the middle of the call), there's an edit about 12 minutes in. We apologise for this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've embedded the video here so you can watch it without needing to go to YouTube:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="youtube-video"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tEfrr-Oe5XA?rel=0&amp;amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;and we'll be updating this with an audio-only version in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire Series Playlist is here, if you don't want to miss out on future episodes: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsfV1BOiVrnF5TiOOxaWE696A_59gz1sp"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsfV1BOiVrnF5TiOOxaWE696A_59gz1sp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your region would like to be part of this project, please email us at &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:scottishrollerderby@gmail.com"&gt;scottishrollerderby@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt; to discuss, or get in touch via our Instagram or Facebook pages - we'd love to hear from you (and help the world hear about you too)! We're currently working on 3 regions for new Vodcasts, but we don't have a limit as yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>baltic roller derby</category><category>baltic witches</category><category>estonian roller derby</category><category>fab slav</category><category>ingria rollers</category><category>lativian roller derby</category><category>riga roller derby</category><category>roller derby eesti liit</category><category>roller derby sevens</category><category>russian roller derby</category><category>short track roller derby</category><category>st petersburg roller derby</category><category>tallin roller derby</category><category>tartu roller derby</category><category>team russia roller derby</category><category>vodcasts</category><category>white night furies</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2020/04/Vodcasts-BalticRus/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Weekend Highlights: 02 Nov 2019</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/highlights/2019/weekendhighlights-02112019/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being a bit busy, we're trying a new thing this week to give us more space, and are grouping all "National tournament" fixtures on a date for a given country into one entry - so here, Dijon and Saint-Gratien share a Championnat de France spot. With this being the week of Halloween, there's a lot of "spooky" events earlier in the week and on the weekend, but there's some very exciting other developments, including the first internal interleague bout in Uruguay, Liverpool Roller Birds' 10th anniversary, and the Rebellion tournament returning to Melbourne for another year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...but, perhaps most importantly, there's the first ever bout in Tallinn, Estonia, which is also the start of Estonia's first National Tournament series!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention, and because it's quiet enough that we have the space.&lt;/p&gt;

We have a lot of derby happening across the world, including a three-day bootcamp in Estonia (covering WFTDA, Roller Derby Sevens and Short Track), and even more variant games in Australia, as South Sea Roller Derby host another Rainbow Lightning tournament (which is a ruleset we'd love to see people try in Europe sometime).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Scotland, New Town Roller Derby host a Charity LGBT scrimmage, to support West Lothian Pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture

&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've broken our rule slightly for Germany this weekend, as it's important not to miss the Mine Monsters' birthday game, but also it's a good weekend for the German Bundesliga in Erfurt. And as usual there's so much stuff in France, we're giving them two entries for two two-day events...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also two firsts this weekend; the first ever Tasmanian Tournament kicks off in Australia, and the first ever Norwegian National Tournament (and Championship) is this weekend in Sadnes!&lt;/p&gt;
