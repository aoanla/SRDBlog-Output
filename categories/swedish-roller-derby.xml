&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;

Apologies to France, then, this week: we had to pick a small number of the many events you have on in order to keep to our rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture

(As most of the events in Latin America are on Sunday, that means that the map for this update looks a bit unbalanced...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a bunch of things this &lt;em&gt;Thursday&lt;/em&gt; - mostly open scrimmages, in Aberdeen, Geneva, and Bundaberg (the latter is a "pot luck" game, so open to the public, but still open subs). On the weekend, Helsinki is celebrating 10 years of Roller Derby in Finland with a party; and Cologne are celebrating 10 years of derby in Köln with a two-day international tournament! (Blackpool are also celebrating 7 years with a party on Friday.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big national events are in Innsbruck, where the Fearless Bruisers host the third ever Austrian National Championship, and in Toulouse, where the Championnat de France Nationale 1 has a two-day fixture. (In Turku, there's a Suomi Cup fixture, but it's closed to the public.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).

In this case, the 2019 Mexican National Championships are in Querétaro, and the Brasilian Nationals are in Blumenau. (Plus, of course, this is the weekend of WFTDA's Championships). In addition, the ongoing Finnish and French tournament fixtures recur again this weekend...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... and there are big tournaments in Kiel, Regensburg, Cambridge, Wiltshire, and Buenos Aires!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[We'd also like to shout out the bout in Japan, for Yokosuka Sushi Rollers versus Kamikaze Badass, and also Tel Aviv Roller Derby's open scrim!]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is busy enough that we're going to have a second, short, Sunday-only update later in the week so we can fit more geographical range in here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Plus, more that we've not got space to summarise up here, and you'll have to read down for!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture

&lt;p&gt;Quite apart from those, there are also international events in Newcastle (as Newcastle Roller Girls celebrate 10 years), Vienna,  and Vicenza; Short Track Roller Derby and referee clinics in Buenos Aires; and a National Meeting of minds in Manizales, Colombia!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're not even mentioning the Short Track Roller Derby events this weekend to save space - they're all in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/10/shorttrack-102019/"&gt;this roundup post&lt;/a&gt; if you want to catch up with them (although we've marked them on the map). They're all highlights, but this is a super busy weekend, so something has to give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3rd fixture of the Chilean national tournament happens this weekend, as does the final of the New Zealand Top 10 Championshops 2019; as well as a number of large tournament events (perhaps the largest being in Sydney, Australia, and Lille, France). There's charity derby in Teesside, and even an international roller derby bootcamp up north in Iceland!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Map of all events (coded by type)" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/10/19Oct-wkly-map.png" style="width: 100%;"&gt;

Facebook's event search tools are not good at finding events unless they're physically close to you; and they've disabled or limited most of the ways of reading lots of data from their site. Instagram doesn't provide any way to search for events at all; and not enough leagues have websites with rss feeds or calendars that we can pull from to make this reliable. (And, whilst &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; games get listed on Flat Track Stats, not all do; and not all events are bouts, or bouts which are suitable for ranking!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd like to encourage leagues, again, to &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:scottishrollerderby@gmail.com"&gt;email us&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/scottish.rollerderby/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; message us, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/scottishrollerderby/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; message us (or join our &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discord.gg/8CJPyjq"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; server and talk to us there) to let us know about your events; or tell us how to (automatically) track your calendars if you have them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd like to return to a few events we missed last weekend, though, just to restore the balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, in Uppsala, first fixtures of the Division 2 Swedish Nationals series for 2019/20 saw the hosts ( &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.uppsalarollerderby.se/"&gt;Jackdaw City Rollers&lt;/a&gt; ) compete in a round robin with Örebro's Nerike Knockouts and Sundsvall's Demolition Rollers, over 2 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/735468933551752/"&gt;[FACEBOOK LINK]&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://flattrackstats.com/tournaments/111774/overview"&gt;[FTS EVENT]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Flyer for the Seriespel Division 2, showing times and attendees." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/10/jackdawcityseriespel.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire event was streamed on the Sweden-based Solidsport platform, and at the time of writing, "replays" [saved copies of the stream] are available at: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://solidsport.com/uppsala-roller-derby/replays"&gt;https://solidsport.com/uppsala-roller-derby/replays&lt;/a&gt; although registration is required to view them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;130&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;252&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sundsvall&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;186&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Uppsala&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next Division 2 fixture is in the December, and sees Uppsala face Helsingborg's Helltown, the final member of the series; before the division completes in the new year for the final games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hosts of this event, Jackdaw City Rollers / Uppsala Roller Derby, are currently experiencing significant difficulties with their training venue, having had their practice times and halls abruptly curtailed at short notice. For more information, and to support them by signing a petition, go here: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.mittskifte.org/petitions/rattvisare-fordelning-av-halltider-i-uppsala"&gt;https://www.mittskifte.org/petitions/rattvisare-fordelning-av-halltider-i-uppsala&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over in Brazil, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/capivaras.rollerderby/"&gt;Capivaras Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; (of Piracicaba) hosted a double header event with guests Gray City Rebels of São Paulo on Sunday. The Capivaras have been avoiding Facebook Events, so we missed this when it was just a flyer...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B22p2wWpEIt/"&gt;[INSTAGRAM FLYER]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Image of some of the action from the first scrimmage." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/10/Graycity.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Action from Brazil (Photo: Gray City Rebels)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Capivaras told us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This Sunday’s (09/29) Match, which happened in Piracicaba, a city in the countryside of the state of São Paulo, was a friendly mixed match between two leagues: the home team, Capivaras Roller Derby, and the Gray City Rebels, from São Paulo, the state capital. A large part of the refereeing team was also from São Paulo.
We held two mixed matches in order to provide the opportunities for all the skaters present. In the morning, we held a full-contact game with the debut of some players from the Grays and one from the Capivaras team, and in the afternoon a non-contact game with the return of some Capivara players to the track and the debut of some of the Grays' fresh meat!
More than a great opportunity to put players in the track and train their abilities in the game; the matches were also an opportunity to make new friends and strengthen the full potential of the roller derby in Brazil!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a significant event which deserves more coverage, although being wholly-North-American, it's outside of our self-imposed limit on highlights...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawai'i saw their annual Battle of the Islands event last weekend. This year, the event was hosted by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.pacificrollerderby.com/"&gt;Pacific Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; (O'ahu), with teams competing from Maui Roller Girls, Garden Isle Renegade Rollers (Kaua'i), and the "Big Island Mashup Team" (representing Echo City Knockouts and Waimea W ), as well as the hosts themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/680267739053588/"&gt;[FACEBOOK EVENT]&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as the main tournament, run as a 4 team round robin, the event also featured a Junior Roller derby exhibition bout by the Honolulu LeiOuts, and a closing Black v White scrimmage. The Friday before the tournament additionally saw an Officiating Clinic, for all visiting officials (referees and NSOs), run by the very well travelled Mass The Ref.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire tournament was also livestreamed on YouTube, and we link to the video in each game in the table (none of these videos are full-length, as far as we can tell).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scores were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope to bring you a detailed article on the state of Roller Derby in Hawai'i later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>brazilian roller derby</category><category>capivaras roller derby</category><category>gray city rollers</category><category>maui roller girls</category><category>mea culpa</category><category>pacific roller derby</category><category>roller derby hawaii</category><category>sundsvall roller derby</category><category>swedish roller derby</category><category>uppsala roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/10/meaculpa290919/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2019 07:55:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Weekend Highlights: 05 October 2019</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/highlights/2019/weekendhighlights-05102019/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an exciting week for Scottish Roller Derby, with both Edinburgh's Auld Reekie, and Glasgow Roller Derby competing in international tournaments (ARRD in the Continental Cup in Helsinki, and GRD in the Kick Ass Cup in Hamburg). And, to add to that, this is the weekend of the annual Big Blether Scottish Roller Derby Conference, so all the leagues will be coming together there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also two-day international tournaments in Sweden, the Mexican National Division 2 Championships in Léon, Sudestada Roller Derby's debut bout in Necochea, and more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention, and because it's quiet enough that we have the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;

Queensland's state tournament has its Grand Final this Saturday; as does British Championships, with their Playoffs deciding the winners in both divisions. There are several leagues celebrating reaching their 1st decade of existence in various ways, an exciting bootcamp in Cancùn, Mexico, and a lot of roller derby in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;

As well as a second WFTDA Playoffs showcasting Sweden, and giving the UK it's second chance at a Champs place, there's equally exciting action in the USA for Brussels Derby Pixies in California; the finals of Victoria's Statewide Stampede tournament in Australia; the start of Finland's Suomi Cup for 2019/2020... and much more!&lt;/p&gt;
