&lt;p&gt;We're back today with the eighth edition, featuring the Roller Derby community in Argentina, with reps from Buenos Aires' Sailor City Rollers, Cordoba's Hiedras Roller Derby, Jujuy's Mortal Kollas, and Ushuaia's Piratas del Beagle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlights include footage from Ushuaia's Torneo Patagonia Rebelde (the most southerly Roller Derby tournament in the world), the very first Torneo Violentango, and the 2x4 Roller Derby versus Sailor City Rollers game from 2018's WFTDA Continental Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've embedded the video here so you can watch it without needing to go to YouTube:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="youtube-video"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CaM-d81CDzc?rel=0&amp;amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;and we'll be updating this with an audio-only version in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire Series Playlist is here, if you don't want to miss out on future episodes: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsfV1BOiVrnF5TiOOxaWE696A_59gz1sp"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsfV1BOiVrnF5TiOOxaWE696A_59gz1sp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We're currently working on 3 regions for new Vodcasts, but we don't have a limit as yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>argentine roller derby</category><category>continental cup</category><category>hiedras roller derby</category><category>mortal kollas roller derby</category><category>piratas del beagle</category><category>sailor city rollers</category><category>torneo patagonia rebelde</category><category>vodcasts</category><category>wftda</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2020/06/Vodcasts-Argentina/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jun 2020 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Weekend Highlights: 2019-2020 End of Year</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/highlights/2019/weekendhighlights-20192020/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're finally in a place where the majority of festive events are dying down, so this special edition of the Weekend Highlights, like the festive Radio Times in the UK, is a bumper multi-week edition, to tide you over until the second week of the New Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;

Apologies to France, then, this week: we had to pick a small number of the many events you have on in order to keep to our rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture

&lt;p&gt;A lot of our Sunday highlights this time are festive open scrimmages, in Australia, New Zealand, Wales, and England. But in Argentina there's a 1 day tournament using Short Track Roller Derby rules; in France a rookies bootcamp and a triple header, and in Mexico, a single bout to close the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).

&lt;p&gt;This Saturday and whole-weekend, though, we have a host of highlights, including Nottingham's 10th anniversary, a whole-weekend bootcamp with ShortStop in Thailand, and a quadruple header in the south of France with Roller Derby Toulouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).

&lt;p&gt;As well as action in Colombia as part of the 10th anniversary of Roller Derby in the country, there's also a bunch of open scrims in Australia and the UK, a triple header in France, action in Mexico and Argentina... and more chances to try Short Track Roller Derby in Worcester, UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture

(As most of the events in Latin America are on Sunday, that means that the map for this update looks a bit unbalanced...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a bunch of things this &lt;em&gt;Thursday&lt;/em&gt; - mostly open scrimmages, in Aberdeen, Geneva, and Bundaberg (the latter is a "pot luck" game, so open to the public, but still open subs). On the weekend, Helsinki is celebrating 10 years of Roller Derby in Finland with a party; and Cologne are celebrating 10 years of derby in Köln with a two-day international tournament! (Blackpool are also celebrating 7 years with a party on Friday.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big national events are in Innsbruck, where the Fearless Bruisers host the third ever Austrian National Championship, and in Toulouse, where the Championnat de France Nationale 1 has a two-day fixture. (In Turku, there's a Suomi Cup fixture, but it's closed to the public.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;

There's multiple tournaments and international bouts: returning tournaments in Belgium, with Skate Around #3;  in Italy, with Scusa Mamma, Ma Sono Una Derby Girl; and in Argentina, with Juguemos Pué; in the UK, returing Roller Derby Sevens and Sur5al events; and continuing tournament series in Germany, France, and Japan (where Derby Nights 4x4's fixture is extra long due to the postponed bout in October).&lt;/p&gt;
