&lt;p&gt;In 2020, though, we already have a very strong candidate, as Egypt's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cairollers.com"&gt;CaiRollers&lt;/a&gt; and South Africa's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goldencityrollers.com/"&gt;Golden City Rollers&lt;/a&gt; make history with the first every intra-African Roller Derby tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we've written about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/06/rollerderby-za-2019/"&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt;, South African roller derby exists in its own geographical bubble, far from other nations; but the CaiRollers have had almost as much trouble finding regular opponents (despite being just across the Mediterranean from Greece, and not that far from Italy and Austria). After making history with the first MENA game (against Abu Dhabi Roller Derby in Janrary 2017), and playing Marseille's Bloody Skulls in mid 2017, the CaiRollers have had no other international opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The 'A Frican Good Time' Flyer, large text of the event name in block capitals over diagonally divided field of red (top left) and gold (bottom right). Red part of field has subtle ancient Egyptian hieroglyph pattern, gold part of field has subtle Zulu-style geometric patterning. To the left of the text is a jammer, whose flesh is invisible, but whose clothing and kit are red, black and gold." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2020/03/africangoodtimeflyer.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, since October 2018, they've been planning something more audacious: raising funds to travel themselves, down to Johannesburg. Readers will remember their &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cairollers-to-south-africa/#"&gt;Indiegogo&lt;/a&gt; fundraiser, which did not reach its target, to achieve this by 2019... but the funds that were raised there have been the basis of further money-raising within Cairo itself. Profits from local events, including a recent home teams game at the start of February, have all been funnelled into the venture, and individual skaters have spent personal funds on making their flight bookings. This will be the CaiRollers' first ever away bout, and it's a huge step to make in addition to the usual issues that come with playing away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has always been a collaborative effort between Golden City Rollers and the CaiRollers, but as GCR told us, it's grown since the initial plan of just a single game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"CaiRollers first contacted us with the idea for this event in October 2018, and we have literally been counting the days since! Last year, GCR and CaiRollers decided to run a tournament instead of just one game and we invited other South African leagues to participate. With travel costs being a challenge, Durban Roller Derby and Cape Town Rollergirls opted to form a mixed team, along with some players from UAE All Stars, where an ex-GCR-skater currently lives. They'll compete together as the Pan-African Rollers. It's been both challenging and exciting pulling together our first international tournament, but we've learned a lot along the way and we're hoping this will be the first of many more to come. Only days to go now...we can't wait to have all the teams here and on the track!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also makes this the first year that South Africa will host two tournaments with teams from across their own country: normally this happens just the once, in their end-of-year Derbyfest. As with Derbyfest last year, this will be a three-teams round-robin, followed by a "finals" playoff for the top two teams from that stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are assured that there will be a complete livestream for all games in the tournament schedule, although the link for this is yet to be distributed. (We'd keep an eye on GCR's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/228775404810943/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; event page for more info.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the public schedule, there will also be an all-day bootcamp on the Saturday, providing maximum benefit to all attending teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to bring you a longer article as a post-mortem on the whole event, in a few weeks' time, but for now: put a pin in this for your diary!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>a frican good time</category><category>cairollers</category><category>egyptian roller derby</category><category>emirates roller derby</category><category>golden city rollers</category><category>south african roller derby</category><category>uae roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2020/03/AfricanGoodTimePre/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2020 08:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>South Africa's National Derby Fest 2019</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/10/nationalderbyfest-102019/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South African National Roller Derby Festival ("National Derby Fest") may be the smallest of the National Tournaments we covered &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/10/31/south-africas-national-derby-fest-2018-three-years-of-festivals/"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; , but it's also potentially one of the more important to its community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we covered in our article on the South African roller derby community &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/06/rollerderby-za-2019/"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; , the population of South Africa is concentrated in a small number of widely-separated areas, so it's very expensive for the teams to play each other (let alone teams from other nations). As such, having this one big event at the end of the year is an achievable focus, and the community time it provides is all the valuable for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In last year's NDF, Johannesburg's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://goldencityrollers.com"&gt;Golden City Rollers&lt;/a&gt; , and Cape Town Rollergirls competed for the final rankings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Golden City Rollers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cape Town Rollergirls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The third team present, Durban Roller Derby, participated in the first two bouts, mixed teams games with skaters from all three teams.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt='The flyer image for this National Derby Fest: crouched jammer ready to sprint at start of whistle (in black and white, with red star), against horizontally divided yellow and red background box; yellow bar at top of flyer, red at bottom. Second box (positioned "on top" of the background, but "behind" the skater) reads "National Roller Derby Festival 2019". The logos of all three leagues with full teams are aligned along the bottom of the flyer.' src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/10/NDF2019.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/403124207306199/"&gt;National Derby Fest&lt;/a&gt; has a change of format, designed to maximise the amount of game play each team got. As such, this is National Derby Fest is a double round robin: each team will play the others &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt;, in half-length games (two 15 minute periods). As numbers for all teams are a little low this year, this will allow everyone to participate in as much derby as possible, whilst still playing WFTDA-rules otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth league in South Africa, Pretoria's P-Town Roller Derby, will be donating a skater to the Cape Town team, and we assume will be donating volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winners on points will go forward to play each other in a full-length WFTDA-regulation Final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golden City Rollers told us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
NDF is the highlight of the local derby calendar, so we're super excited to host it this year, and to see all our sister leagues again. Of course, the most important thing is to play some derby and enjoy every second, as we don't often get a chance to compete in SA. Secondly, it's an opportunity to introduce new spectators to the sport, so we're hoping it will help grow roller derby in SA.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National Derby Fest 2019 will be hosted at: &lt;strong&gt;Uniao Portuguesa&lt;/strong&gt;, 4 Eastwood street, Turffontein, Johannesburg, South Africa, on &lt;strong&gt;9 November&lt;/strong&gt;, starting at 0930.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>golden city rollers</category><category>national derby fest</category><category>south african roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/10/nationalderbyfest-102019/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2019 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Skating at the tip of Africa: Roller Derby in South Africa</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/06/rollerderby-za-2019/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've written a bit about South African roller derby when covering their &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/10/31/south-africas-national-derby-fest-2018-three-years-of-festivals/"&gt;national tournament&lt;/a&gt;, but there's a lot more to be said about the community than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geography informs the way in which Roller Derby develops in a country, and South Africa's is very different to what we're used to in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Map of South Africa's Population density, with leagues marked." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/06/southafrica-popdensity.png"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Map of South Africa's population density, with leagues marked. [Underlay: Htonl (Public domain, Wikipedia)]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa is a large country - its area is about twice that of France - but with a relatively small population - about 80% that of France. And that population is very unevenly spread across the country: the dense province of &lt;strong&gt;Gauteng&lt;/strong&gt;, containing Johannesburg and Pretoria, contains about a &lt;em&gt;quarter&lt;/em&gt; of South Africa's entire population, with another fifth concentrated around Durban in the south-east province of &lt;strong&gt;KwaZulu-Natal&lt;/strong&gt;, and a further eighth around Cape Town in the &lt;strong&gt;Western Cape&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike in most European countries, then, the 4 leagues of South Africa - located in those 4 named cities - have difficulty even travelling to play each other on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add to this the fact that the only other country with Roller Derby in Africa is &lt;em&gt;Egypt&lt;/em&gt;, at the other end of the continent, and you can get a feel for how dedicated and unique the solutions adapted by the South African leagues have had to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we'll be discussing in some depth both those problems, and their solutions, so click on to read more:&lt;/p&gt;
