One such newer tournament is the &lt;strong&gt;Austrian Championship&lt;/strong&gt;, which enters its third year on the 30th of November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked to 2019 hosts, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/fearlessbruisers"&gt;Fearless Bruisers&lt;/a&gt; of Roller Derby Innsbruck about the tournament, and how it is already growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austria has had Roller Derby for some time, with Vienna Roller Derby having been playing since 2011, including internationally. However, for much of that time, they were literally the only league in the country, with most of their bouts played across the borders in Switzerland or Germany (or further afield in Europe). It was only in 2015 that additional teams were founded, in Linz, followed in 2017 by Graz and Innsbruck, and most recently in Salzburg in 2018. In 2020, we expect to see even more leagues form, as the trend of Roller Derby in Central and Eastern Europe continues to point upward.&lt;/p&gt;
