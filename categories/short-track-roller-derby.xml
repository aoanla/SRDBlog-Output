&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of our Sunday highlights this time are festive open scrimmages, in Australia, New Zealand, Wales, and England. But in Argentina there's a 1 day tournament using Short Track Roller Derby rules; in France a rookies bootcamp and a triple header, and in Mexico, a single bout to close the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture

&lt;p&gt;As well as action in Colombia as part of the 10th anniversary of Roller Derby in the country, there's also a bunch of open scrims in Australia and the UK, a triple header in France, action in Mexico and Argentina... and more chances to try Short Track Roller Derby in Worcester, UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture

&lt;p&gt;Quite apart from those, there are also international events in Newcastle (as Newcastle Roller Girls celebrate 10 years), Vienna,  and Vicenza; Short Track Roller Derby and referee clinics in Buenos Aires; and a National Meeting of minds in Manizales, Colombia!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Plus, more that we've not got space to summarise up here, and you'll have to read down for!)&lt;/p&gt;

Even doing that, it's a packed schedule, including: Bologna's Hyenas hosting two days of roller derby at the Ferrara Tattoo Convention, a double header of derby up in Aberdeen, Nantes and Gdańsk both hosting events to celebrate their leagues' respective anniversaries,  a whole sur5al tournament in New Zealand, and a &lt;em&gt;two-track&lt;/em&gt; international tournament in Hull! (And more - the first MRDA-sanctioned triple header in Spain, a weekend of derby in Querétaro... !)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're trying to stick to our rules below, so a lot of events - especially in Australia, which is currently at the height of its Spring events schedule - are having to be missed off the list. (We're open to considering treating very large countries in terms of their constituent States, for the purpose of allowing events, but we'd like the community to let us know how they feel about that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams

&lt;p&gt;We're not even mentioning the Short Track Roller Derby events this weekend to save space - they're all in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/10/shorttrack-102019/"&gt;this roundup post&lt;/a&gt; if you want to catch up with them (although we've marked them on the map). They're all highlights, but this is a super busy weekend, so something has to give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3rd fixture of the Chilean national tournament happens this weekend, as does the final of the New Zealand Top 10 Championshops 2019; as well as a number of large tournament events (perhaps the largest being in Sydney, Australia, and Lille, France). There's charity derby in Teesside, and even an international roller derby bootcamp up north in Iceland!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).

There are exciting things to write about, across the world, as well, so we'll break this up region by region! Because of the prevalence of Facebook (and the fact that its Events are one of the few useful things about it), all links to events will be there; but we'll include enough info for you to get to the event without needing anything owned by Mark Zuckerberg. Where possible, we link to league websites, or to their Instagram when it isn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/vendavalrollerderby/"&gt;Vendaval Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; are one of the newer teams hailing from the Argentinian part of Patagonia, in their case, Comodoro Rivadavia. In fact, the 22nd of September will mark only their first year of existence... and for most leagues, that first year doesn't have much in it but building up. Vendaval have certainly been doing that, and they want to spend their anniversary helping do the same for the rest of the Patagonian community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Flyer for Vendaval Roller Derby's Anniversary." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/09/vendaval_flyer.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, that community has been working together as a closely-allied group, transcending team boundaries for some time now. Indeed, despite the challenges of the region, Patagonia has hosted the southern-most roller derby tournament for several years running now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, this first anniversary is also a center for more developments in this area: the anniversary event is somewhere between a bootcamp and a convocation for Patagonian leagues. As well as theoretical sessions on dealing with injuries and proper exercise, run by coaching service &lt;em&gt;LP Deportes en Patín&lt;/em&gt;, there will also be physical training sessions, and a large shared lunch designed to encourage sharing and connection between the attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Collaboration is essential, but holding games also needs infrastructure and resources. Vendaval will be hosting the first ever public exploration of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rollaskateclub.com/short-track-roller-derby-resources/"&gt;Short Track Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt;  in Argentina in aid of this.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we've &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/categories/short-track-roller-derby/"&gt;written about&lt;/a&gt; before, Short Track Roller Derby is a version of the sport created by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rollaskateclub.com"&gt;Rolla Skate Club&lt;/a&gt; to enable derby to be played with less space, time, resources and officials than the more established versions do. As such, it's an excellent additional tool to help Roller Derby develop and progress in regions, like Patagonia, where recruitment may be harder, and finding suitable spaces for a full-size WFTDA-standard track impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vendaval Roller Derby's birthday event will start at &lt;strong&gt;9am&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;22nd September&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be hosted at:
&lt;em&gt;Club In. Luis A. Huergo, Av. del Libertador 450, Comodoro Rivadavia, Chubut, Argentina&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>argentine roller derby</category><category>latin american roller derby</category><category>rolla skate club</category><category>short track roller derby</category><category>vendaval roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/09/Vendaval_shorttrack/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2019 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Weekend Highlights: 03 August 2019</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/highlights/2019/weekendhighlights-03082019/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is another "all weekend in one update" set of highlights, although there are several exciting events this weekend: the first fixture of the Chilean national tournament, the Torneo X, in Valdivia; the MRDA Men's European Qualifiers in Aberdeen; and Argentina meet Uruguay in Buenos Aires, for one of Tempestad Roller Derby's first games (plus raising funds for 2x4 to attend in WFTDA Playoffs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was edited on the 1st August to include late announced events in Dubai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;

Skaters from all three Chinese-region leagues - Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong - were present, for the all day event.&lt;/p&gt;
