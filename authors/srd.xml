So, whilst some Nationals - in, say Mexico or Sweden - have been running for a very long time - there's always new National tournaments forming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 1st of February, Denmark held its first &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/764179684037734/"&gt;National Tournament&lt;/a&gt; in 4 years, taking the unusual (worldwide) step of using the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rsdpDACXou9PL_wIZgPhZltHvF0ScWmlcyfhH6uWTC4/"&gt;Roller Derby Sevens&lt;/a&gt; ruleset.
This tournament was the result of both conception and huge commitment by one person - &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://aalborgrollerderby.dk/"&gt;Aalborg Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; 's Möxie Crüel, so we caught up with her to discuss the genesis of the tournament, it's aims and plans for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2010, Perú has hosted Roller Derby in the form of its only league, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/toxiclimarollerderby/"&gt;Toxic Lima Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; . We have been lucky enough to be able to talk to one of their longer-standing members, Twerkin Pony, about the history, and present, of Roller Derby in Perú.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt='The Toxic Lima Roller Derby logo: all in black and white with no shading. stylised head wearing full-face gas mask, and WW1 style helmet, with TXL displayed on the helmet crown.

&lt;p&gt;Whilst they might seem superficially different, Roller Derby and Role Playing Games have a surprising amount in common, including having experienced more than one resurgence of popular interest driven by pop cultural reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Roller Derby has &lt;em&gt;Whip It&lt;/em&gt;, and now &lt;em&gt;Birds of Prey&lt;/em&gt;; RPGs (and especially their most famous example, Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons), have appearances in &lt;em&gt;E.T.&lt;/em&gt; (and their own cartoon) in the 80s and &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; in the present day, as well as increasing popularity through “actual play”, role playing game campaigns streamed live, or recorded, on Twitch, YouTube or as podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Libby Horacek has made the, perhaps obvious in retrospect, step of connecting the two, via an RPG set in the context of Roller Derby itself… a game of tactics on track and management and feelings off track, which can only have one name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="derby-drama"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://derbydrama.com"&gt;Derby Drama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="The Derby Drama kickstarter logo" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2020/02/derbydrama_original.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here at SRD we like both Roller Derby and RPGs, and we know that there’s a huge crossover between D&amp;amp;D players and skaters, so we thought it was worth catching up with Libby to talk about all things Derby, RPGs and anything else, starting with how this all started for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the AWARDS page for the first ever SRDB Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ground-rules for the Awards are covered in the launch post &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/11/srdbawards-nom-2019/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in that link, voting was by &lt;em&gt;approval voting&lt;/em&gt;.
This means that you could, and should, tick boxes for all of the nominees you thought would deserve to win. You could tick all the boxes, if you thought they're all deserving; you could tick no boxes if you think none were deserving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get into the winners of each award, some statistics on the voting: we let you choose which categories to vote on, so some categories were voted on more than others.
In general, the categories with the longest list of nominees were the ones with the most votes, predictably; the category with the fewest votes &lt;strong&gt;BOOTCAMP&lt;/strong&gt; had about 7.5% of the votes cast on the category with the most, &lt;strong&gt;SKATER&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fraction of voters voting for more than one nominee varied significantly across the categories: with only two nominees, only 1 voter voted for both &lt;strong&gt;BOOTCAMP&lt;/strong&gt; nominees; whilst 38% of voters voted for more than one &lt;strong&gt;HALL OF FAME&lt;/strong&gt; nominee. Overall, (ignoring the &lt;strong&gt;RISING STAR&lt;/strong&gt; category as it had additional voting rules), 17% of votes were cast for multiple nominees, across the categories - this is a little higher than the average for this voting scheme in other deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also let you cast a vote for &lt;em&gt;no-one&lt;/em&gt;, if you didn't think any nominee deserved it in a category. Again, ignoring RISING STAR, only 4 such null votes were cast, around 0.2% of votes in total. This is a little lower than the average for systems which let you place null votes, which is encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that statistical interlude out of the way, lets get on with the main matter, the winners in each category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="awards"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AWARDS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="skater"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;SKATER&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Skater award had the largest number of votes of any category in the awards. Despite this, the clear winner, with more than 50% of the voters, was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ELO C RAPTOR&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;Harpies Roller Derby Milano&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="coach"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;COACH&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Coaching award was both popular (with more than 200 voters casting opinions), and very tightly contested, with the top 4 by votes all within 7 votes of each other. The winner, pipping the others to the post was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROSIE PEACOCK&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;New Wheeled Order&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Power of Scotland&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="referee"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;REFEREE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Referee award was also very popular, with more than 200 voters, but had a very clear margin for the winner (although still short of an overall majority)...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NICOLA'S RAGE&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;Crimson Vipers Roller Derby Bergamo&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="non-skating-official"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;NON-SKATING OFFICIAL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NSO award was not quite as heavily voted on, with more than 100 votes cast in total. The runaway winner, just 1% short of an overall majority, and with twice the votes of the next highest placed nominee...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KEDROG&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;Granite City Brawlers&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="announcer"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ANNOUNCER&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With only 3 nominees, the Announcer category had some interesting voting patterns... and a very clear winner. With a majority of the vote, the winning announcer was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRAEME MCPHAIL&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;Bairn City Rollers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="photographer"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;PHOTOGRAPHER&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Photographer category was the second most voted on category of all in the awards, with almost 250 votes cast in total. Despite this, it was also a very tightly contested category between the top 3, who remained within 10 votes of each other for the entire voting period (and changed position more than once).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the winning photographer was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VINCIANE PIÉRART&lt;/strong&gt; (NSP189)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="volunteer"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;VOLUNTEER&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Volunteer category, with only 3 candidates, was another with interesting patterns of voting. The overwhelming winner, with a supermajority of votes, was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUDREY&lt;/strong&gt; ... ex-Dundee Roller Derby, and sort of semi-retired volunteer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="league"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;LEAGUE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;League was another popular category, with more than 200 voters casting overall. It was also a very convincingly won category, with the margin between 1st and 2nd place being larger than the total votes cast for 2nd. Despite this, winning by a plurality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE ANGUANAS&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;Vicenza, Italy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tournament"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;TOURNAMENT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tournament category saw only just shy of 200 votes cast... and the overall winner had the support of a supermajority of those! It's...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SKATE IM RING 2019&lt;/strong&gt; hosted by &lt;strong&gt;Alp'n Rockets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="non-regulation-tournament"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;NON-REGULATION TOURNAMENT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Non-Regulation Tournament category should probably have been called the "Roller Derby Sevens" category, as all three candidates used that ruleset. This was a pretty tight contest between all three, with the winner by plurality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KRUSTFEST 2019&lt;/strong&gt; hosted independently, in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bootcamp"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;BOOTCAMP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With only two candidates this category went, convincingly, to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"LILY GASKELL AND FAIRY QUAKE'S BOOTCAMPS"&lt;/strong&gt; hosted by &lt;strong&gt;Rainy City Roller Derby&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="media"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;MEDIA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Media award was one of our less voted on categories, despite having a bunch of nominations, and the winning candidate changed over the course of voting... taking a win with a majority of voters when voting closed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The MRDA EUROPEAN QUALIFIERS LIVESTREAM&lt;/strong&gt; hosted on &lt;strong&gt;YouTube&lt;/strong&gt;, run with &lt;strong&gt;Granite City Brawlers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="hall-of-fame"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;HALL OF FAME&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hall of Fame category is something of a wildcard category, and had an eclectic range of nominees. This might explain why almost two-fifths of voters voted for more than one candidate in this category! Despite this, there was a clear winner, only just shy of an overall majority...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first Hall of Fame member is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5TH BLOCKER SKATES&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Glasgow&lt;/strong&gt;'s own Roller Derby shop!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rising-star"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;RISING STAR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we come to the Rising Star category, for junior skaters, or up-and-coming younger skaters in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to some anomalies in the nomination process, and also to especially encourage voters in this category to vote on the basis of deserving, rather than just popularity, this category required you to vote for 2 or more nominees. (Votes for a single nominee were considered the same as a vote for no-one.) Despite this being clearly described on both the Nominees page, and on the actual voting form (in two places on the latter), a number of voters still voted for a single candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, including these single votes would not have changed the overall winner (although it would change the margin of win, and the ordering of all the other positions). The Winner, with a significant margin in terms of valid votes, was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;red OWEch (Owen Squires)&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;Newcastle Junior Roller Derby (Australia)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst there's no official prize for winning an SRDB Award (and we consider being Nominated to be the real point), we'd be happy to work with any of the winners on a "Winners Profile" to be published later in the month or year. Please get in touch with us if you are a winner (or the nominee of a winner) if you want to work with us on this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the HUB page for the first ever SRDB Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ground-rules for the Awards are covered in the launch post &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/11/srdbawards-nom-2019/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in that link, voting is by &lt;em&gt;approval voting&lt;/em&gt;.
This means that you can, and should, tick boxes for all of the nominees you think would deserve to win. You can tick all the boxes, if you think they're all deserving; you can tick no boxes if you think none are deserving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone gets &lt;em&gt;a single submission&lt;/em&gt; per category (with as many boxes ticked as they want); we have enabled detection of multiple submissions on these forms, and will also be taking action against unusual voting patterns which get past this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The individual links for each nomination are below: Each Nomination is listed along with the reasons for their nomination, as supplied by their nominator. For submissions in a language other than English, we've supplied a translation into English (errors are ours). For multiple nominations for a single nominee, we've combined the reasons together (we've edited where needed, and removed repetition that results).&lt;/p&gt;

Starting back in 2009, RRQ were the start of a rapid swell of Colombian roller derby - over the following two years, a full 10 leagues had come into existence, many (including RRQ) based in the capital, Bogotá, but also across the other cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt='The Rock N Roller Queens tenth-anniversary logo: team in background in desaturated colour, overlayed by red/orange/yellow stylised "RRQ AÑOS" across a large X, with stylised crown atop, and "REINANDO" below.' src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/11/RnRQ-X.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rapid growth of Roller Derby in Colombia, their first National Tournament was held in 2012, and the Rock n Roller Queens won, defeating second place Bogotá Bone Breakers (who were also the second league to form in the country). The following month, July 2012, they also made history by being accepted as the first ever South American league to join the WFTDA Apprentice program. They were also one of the few leagues in Colombia to have both A and B teams, with their Queens forming soon after their membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of RRQ's teams were also founding members of Bogotá's "District Tournament", which has run from 2014 to 2018 so far. The District Tournament has been one of two tournaments feeding into Colombia's National Tournament (the other being their Regional Tournament covering the areas outside Bogotá), and RRQ have never failed to qualify for that event, in years in which it has run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2014 to 2016, as full WFTDA members, RRQ's travel team actively participated in WFTDA Sanctioned Play, with a consistent performance (taking into account the rapid growth of leagues, and the inherent inflationary nature of WFTDA Ratings year-on-year). In the last few years, no Colombian team has achieved a WFTDA ranking...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...however, on their 10th anniversary, RRQ told us that they have plans to change this. Over their lifespan, the Rock n Roller Queens have undergone what they refer to as "important generational changes", and the new league are planning to make a splash on the WFTDA Sanctioned tournament circuit in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this, Rock n Roller Queens are also planning a rebranding exercise, which will be open to artists across the world. (We &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; that this won't be expecting the artists to work for free...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're looking forward to RRQ's 2020... but before that, they're hosting their annual " &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/465425780743863/"&gt;Derbynaldos&lt;/a&gt; " [link to Facebook] end of year contest this weekend, which has a special resonance in this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>colombian roller derby</category><category>rock n roller queens</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/11/RNR-102019/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2019 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The First SRDB Awards - Nominations Open!</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/11/srdbawards-nom-2019/</link><dc:creator>SRD</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;End of Year awards are a tradition in a lot of communities, and they're one way to highlight and recognise contribution within that community. For the last several years, the Talk Derby To Me podcast ran them for Roller Derby. With TDTM in a quiescent state currently, we reached out to the podcast's founder to get permission to take on the mantle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might guess from this post existing, he agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this article will introduce the ground-rules for the first ever &lt;strong&gt;SRDB Awards&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="srdb-awards-2019"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SRDB AWARDS 2019&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt='The SRDB Award Logo: the Scottish Roller Derby Blog Logo (concentric circles, outer circle containing words "Scottish Roller Derby" all-capitals, separated by five-pointed stars, and an inner ring of stars just outside the boundary of the inner circle; inner circle containing a modification of the "lion of scotland", a heraldic lion, facing right, rampant, with a jammer cover on its head), but with a gold/bronze colour scheme applied.' src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/11/SRDB-Award.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SRDB Awards, as with the TDTM Awards before them, are entirely delivered by the &lt;strong&gt;community&lt;/strong&gt;, and provide a chance to recognise contributions to Roller Derby in a range of categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anyone can nominate&lt;/strong&gt; any number of candidates for each and any of our categories: you must, however, provide a suitable reason for why they should win. This reason will be shown to voters when voting, so try to make it convincing! You can nominate for any reason, as long as you explain it. You may nominate in any language, and we will translate [but we may need to talk to you to confirm - please specify your contact details if you want to be contacted].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Even being nominated will give your nominee visibility, so please do nominate even if you are worried about them &lt;em&gt;winning&lt;/em&gt; - winning isn't everything, and being nominated is really the core thing here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(SRDB reserves the right to remove obviously trolling nominations, but we promise to have a light touch here; we will also remove or recategorise nominations which don't match their category.) SRDB will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; nominate anyone for any categories themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey all! I'm King Crazy, an announcer and bench coach. I've been involved in derby for about 9 years, announced around 300 games and benched around 80.
I've been lucky enough to work 4 World Cups (1 as co-tournament head announcer), WFTDA playoffs, MRDA playoffs, ECDX, British Champs Playoffs, amongst others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my guide to what I do to prepare to announce &lt;strong&gt;BEFORE&lt;/strong&gt; the whistle goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2015, however, the National Teams competing at each World Cup have also been represented by their own organisation, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rollerderbynationscommittee.org"&gt;Roller Derby Nations Committee&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2018 Roller Derby World Cup was a product of both organisations working together, for the first time; the RDNC providing valuable direction to the planning for that event from the very start (as the teams were involved in the evaluation process for host nations, as well as voting on the structural considerations for the event). The RDNC also exists to help new National Teams to get their foothold, via the Emerging Nations process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst the Roller Derby Nations Committee has representatives from all eligible Nations, it also has an executive - the Regional Representatives and Global Chair - who progress the business of the Committee, and do the work of liaising with the RDWC, and other International Roller Derby governing bodies, like the WFTDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For much of 2019, several of those Regional Chair positions have been empty; and with many of the National Teams also having been quiescent, or in the process of reforming, it has not been possible to democratically replace them. Whilst the RDNC, in concert with the RDWC, has managed to progress work - in improving and formalising the meaning of a “National Team” to reflect modern political concerns; and in modelling and developing solutions for the next World Cup itself - it cannot work as effectively without a complete executive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with a quorate set of National Team Representatives now in place, it is possible to start the election process for new Regional Representatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The positions up for election in this cycle (to be voted on by the Nations represented by each region) are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;North America Regional Representative&lt;/strong&gt; [representing: Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Team Indigenous, USA, West Indies.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South and Central America Regional Representative&lt;/strong&gt; [representing: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Southern and Central Europe Regional Representative&lt;/strong&gt; [representing: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Northern Europe Regional Representative&lt;/strong&gt; [representing: Denmark, England, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Russia, Scotland, Sweden, Wales]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Currently filled are the positions of Emerging Nations Regional Representative [Jammit Janet | Janet Vincent], Pacific-Indian Ocean Regional Representative [ShortStop | Christine Murray], and the Global Chair [Booty Queen | Michelle Dosson])&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst the allocations of nations between the Representatives are currently uneven, one of the first actions of the new committee will be to address this. (The imbalance is the result of a large number of Emerging Nations graduating via the 2018 World Cup, and there not having been a quorate committee to action changes to the remits of the Representatives since.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application to the Executive is via &lt;strong&gt;nomination&lt;/strong&gt;. Anyone may nominate a candidate for any of the posts, by &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:RollerDerbyNationsCommittee@gmail.com"&gt;emailing the RDNC executive&lt;/a&gt; ( &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:RollerDerbyNationsCommittee@gmail.com"&gt;RollerDerbyNationsCommittee@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt; ), stating the legal (or commonly used, non-Derby) name, the current region they reside in, and the specific post they are being nominated for. You may nominate yourself, as well as being nominated by others.
The closing date for nominations is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;end of day, &lt;strong&gt;Sunday 20th October&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On close of nomination, nominees will all be offered the chance to decline their nomination, if they didn't self-nominate. If they accept, they will have a few days to prepare a statement of intent; and they will also be invited to the RDNC Podio group to be questioned by the National Representatives.
At the end of this process, the Nations will vote, via their Representatives, on each position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full details are available on the RDNC Facebook, here: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/RollerDerbyNationsCommittee/posts/2458998574382903"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/RollerDerbyNationsCommittee/posts/2458998574382903&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strongly encourage the community to engage with this process, as it really is essential to bring you the next World Cup in good time, and with the best interests of the Nations represented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>national teams</category><category>roller derby nations committee</category><category>roller derby world cup</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/10/RDNC-noms-171019/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 Oct 2019 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Derby Stance 2019</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/10/derbystance-2019/</link><dc:creator>SRD</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past three years, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rulefiftysix.com"&gt;Rule 56&lt;/a&gt; have been helping to drive and develop coaching in Roller Derby; both in terms of coaching itself, and also resources for developing those coaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt='The Derby Stance 2019 logo: 3 brown solid circles of increasing darkness overlapping left-to-right, with blue whistle inside the last. Text "Derby Stance Online Coaching Summit Nov 22-24 2019".' src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/10/DerbyStanceEvent.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very visible part of this has been their &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rulefiftysix.com/derby-stance"&gt;Derby Stance&lt;/a&gt; branded coaching community events; starting with a physical &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/10/03/uks-first-coaching-summit-derby-stance/"&gt;Coaching Summit&lt;/a&gt; back in &lt;em&gt;2016&lt;/em&gt;, and developing into a more extensive, and entirely virtual event in 2018 (2017 tested the concept with a series of individual webinars across the year). Holding the event online, with dedicated conference hosting services, was a response to the global nature of Roller Derby, and the global need for coaching resources and community; having to travel half-way across the world for a conference is not only expensive, but also wasteful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2018 Derby Stance was extremely successful, with attendees describing it with terms like "mind-blowing" and "by far the most helpful coaching training I’ve received in five years"!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Derby Stance Online Coaching Summit is returning for 2019, and Rule 56 have continued to build on and improve on what has been before. As the name suggests, this is, once more, a virtual-only event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with 2018's edition, individual "webinars" which make up the entire 3 day event, are separately bookable; you can buy tickets for just the sessions you're interested in. (If you're planning on attending a lot of the event, though, there's also whole-weekend tickets available, for a discount.).
In a change from last year, these are organised into two types: &lt;em&gt;"Seminars"&lt;/em&gt; (60 minute presentations, with time for questions) and &lt;em&gt;"Workshops"&lt;/em&gt; (90 minute interactive sessions led by the session leader; these are limited to &lt;em&gt;20&lt;/em&gt; attendees each).
(Regular attendees of EROC, the European Roller derby Organisational Conference, will recognise this division from there, where it is pretty effective at supporting different kinds of interaction.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's not all: just like a physical conference, the 2019 Derby Stance will have fringe and break-out events, organised as ad-hoc Facebook Live mini-streams. (Rule56 has already been trialing this with a series of "5 minutes with ..." events over the past year, and they work very well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike most physical conferences, a benefit of the virtual nature is that all Seminars (but not Workshops) will be available after the fact as recordings if you miss them; and simultaneous automated real-time transcriptions will be available during each session, including translated into a range of languages, to aid inclusion and understanding. (For those who can't attend at all, "watch-later" tickets will also be available to access all the content purely post-hoc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any Conference or Summit lives and dies by its roster of speakers, and this year's Derby Stance has a very exciting line-up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smarty Pants (Strong Athletic)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is your Coaching actually working? (Workshop)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jennifer B Gaskins (New Jax City Rollers)&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Rule 56 will be chairing &lt;em&gt;"Round Table"&lt;/em&gt; discussion sessions throughout the event, with topics decided dynamically as the Summit progresses; and the entire event will be introduced with a &lt;strong&gt;WFTDA Keynote Presentation&lt;/strong&gt; the day before the Summit itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets for both individual sessions, and the whole event, are &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rulefiftysix.com/derbystancetickets"&gt;on sale now&lt;/a&gt; . Advance sales for "watch later" tickets for Seminars are cheaper than they will be post-event; and remember that there are only 20 spots for each Workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derby Stance Online Coaching Summit 2019 will run from &lt;strong&gt;22 November 2019 to 24 November 2019&lt;/strong&gt; (with the keynote on the 21st).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Derby Stance would like to thank: WFTDA, Roller Dirty Soaps and Steaks Contact Wear for committing to sponsor this event, and help develop coaching resources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>coaching</category><category>derby stance</category><category>rule 56</category><category>webinar</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/10/derbystance-2019/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2019 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
