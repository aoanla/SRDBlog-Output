Starting back in 2009, RRQ were the start of a rapid swell of Colombian roller derby - over the following two years, a full 10 leagues had come into existence, many (including RRQ) based in the capital, Bogotá, but also across the other cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt='The Rock N Roller Queens tenth-anniversary logo: team in background in desaturated colour, overlayed by red/orange/yellow stylised "RRQ AÑOS" across a large X, with stylised crown atop, and "REINANDO" below.' src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/11/RnRQ-X.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rapid growth of Roller Derby in Colombia, their first National Tournament was held in 2012, and the Rock n Roller Queens won, defeating second place Bogotá Bone Breakers (who were also the second league to form in the country). The following month, July 2012, they also made history by being accepted as the first ever South American league to join the WFTDA Apprentice program. They were also one of the few leagues in Colombia to have both A and B teams, with their Queens forming soon after their membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of RRQ's teams were also founding members of Bogotá's "District Tournament", which has run from 2014 to 2018 so far. The District Tournament has been one of two tournaments feeding into Colombia's National Tournament (the other being their Regional Tournament covering the areas outside Bogotá), and RRQ have never failed to qualify for that event, in years in which it has run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2014 to 2016, as full WFTDA members, RRQ's travel team actively participated in WFTDA Sanctioned Play, with a consistent performance (taking into account the rapid growth of leagues, and the inherent inflationary nature of WFTDA Ratings year-on-year). In the last few years, no Colombian team has achieved a WFTDA ranking...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...however, on their 10th anniversary, RRQ told us that they have plans to change this. Over their lifespan, the Rock n Roller Queens have undergone what they refer to as "important generational changes", and the new league are planning to make a splash on the WFTDA Sanctioned tournament circuit in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this, Rock n Roller Queens are also planning a rebranding exercise, which will be open to artists across the world. (We &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; that this won't be expecting the artists to work for free...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're looking forward to RRQ's 2020... but before that, they're hosting their annual " &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/465425780743863/"&gt;Derbynaldos&lt;/a&gt; " [link to Facebook] end of year contest this weekend, which has a special resonance in this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>colombian roller derby</category><category>rock n roller queens</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/11/RNR-102019/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2019 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The First SRDB Awards - Nominations Open!</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/11/srdbawards-nom-2019/</link><dc:creator>SRD</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;End of Year awards are a tradition in a lot of communities, and they're one way to highlight and recognise contribution within that community. For the last several years, the Talk Derby To Me podcast ran them for Roller Derby. With TDTM in a quiescent state currently, we reached out to the podcast's founder to get permission to take on the mantle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might guess from this post existing, he agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this article will introduce the ground-rules for the first ever &lt;strong&gt;SRDB Awards&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="srdb-awards-2019"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SRDB AWARDS 2019&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt='The SRDB Award Logo: the Scottish Roller Derby Blog Logo (concentric circles, outer circle containing words "Scottish Roller Derby" all-capitals, separated by five-pointed stars, and an inner ring of stars just outside the boundary of the inner circle; inner circle containing a modification of the "lion of scotland", a heraldic lion, facing right, rampant, with a jammer cover on its head), but with a gold/bronze colour scheme applied.' src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/11/SRDB-Award.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SRDB Awards, as with the TDTM Awards before them, are entirely delivered by the &lt;strong&gt;community&lt;/strong&gt;, and provide a chance to recognise contributions to Roller Derby in a range of categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anyone can nominate&lt;/strong&gt; any number of candidates for each and any of our categories: you must, however, provide a suitable reason for why they should win. This reason will be shown to voters when voting, so try to make it convincing! You can nominate for any reason, as long as you explain it. You may nominate in any language, and we will translate [but we may need to talk to you to confirm - please specify your contact details if you want to be contacted].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Even being nominated will give your nominee visibility, so please do nominate even if you are worried about them &lt;em&gt;winning&lt;/em&gt; - winning isn't everything, and being nominated is really the core thing here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(SRDB reserves the right to remove obviously trolling nominations, but we promise to have a light touch here; we will also remove or recategorise nominations which don't match their category.) SRDB will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; nominate anyone for any categories themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey all! I'm King Crazy, an announcer and bench coach. I've been involved in derby for about 9 years, announced around 300 games and benched around 80.
I've been lucky enough to work 4 World Cups (1 as co-tournament head announcer), WFTDA playoffs, MRDA playoffs, ECDX, British Champs Playoffs, amongst others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my guide to what I do to prepare to announce &lt;strong&gt;BEFORE&lt;/strong&gt; the whistle goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/11/KingCrazyAnnounce-Nov19/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (4 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>announcing</category><category>guest posts</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/11/KingCrazyAnnounce-Nov19/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2019 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Roller Derby Nations Committee 2019 -Regional Representative Nominations open!</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/10/RDNC-noms-171019/</link><dc:creator>SRD</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most people associate the Roller Derby World Cups with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rollerderbyworldcup.com"&gt;Roller Derby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; committee, the small organisation which has been running and organising the events since 2011 (although its membership has changed over the years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2015, however, the National Teams competing at each World Cup have also been represented by their own organisation, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rollerderbynationscommittee.org"&gt;Roller Derby Nations Committee&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2018 Roller Derby World Cup was a product of both organisations working together, for the first time; the RDNC providing valuable direction to the planning for that event from the very start (as the teams were involved in the evaluation process for host nations, as well as voting on the structural considerations for the event). The RDNC also exists to help new National Teams to get their foothold, via the Emerging Nations process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst the Roller Derby Nations Committee has representatives from all eligible Nations, it also has an executive - the Regional Representatives and Global Chair - who progress the business of the Committee, and do the work of liaising with the RDWC, and other International Roller Derby governing bodies, like the WFTDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For much of 2019, several of those Regional Chair positions have been empty; and with many of the National Teams also having been quiescent, or in the process of reforming, it has not been possible to democratically replace them. Whilst the RDNC, in concert with the RDWC, has managed to progress work - in improving and formalising the meaning of a “National Team” to reflect modern political concerns; and in modelling and developing solutions for the next World Cup itself - it cannot work as effectively without a complete executive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with a quorate set of National Team Representatives now in place, it is possible to start the election process for new Regional Representatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The positions up for election in this cycle (to be voted on by the Nations represented by each region) are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;North America Regional Representative&lt;/strong&gt; [representing: Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Team Indigenous, USA, West Indies.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South and Central America Regional Representative&lt;/strong&gt; [representing: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Southern and Central Europe Regional Representative&lt;/strong&gt; [representing: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Northern Europe Regional Representative&lt;/strong&gt; [representing: Denmark, England, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Russia, Scotland, Sweden, Wales]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Currently filled are the positions of Emerging Nations Regional Representative [Jammit Janet | Janet Vincent], Pacific-Indian Ocean Regional Representative [ShortStop | Christine Murray], and the Global Chair [Booty Queen | Michelle Dosson])&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst the allocations of nations between the Representatives are currently uneven, one of the first actions of the new committee will be to address this. (The imbalance is the result of a large number of Emerging Nations graduating via the 2018 World Cup, and there not having been a quorate committee to action changes to the remits of the Representatives since.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application to the Executive is via &lt;strong&gt;nomination&lt;/strong&gt;. Anyone may nominate a candidate for any of the posts, by &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:RollerDerbyNationsCommittee@gmail.com"&gt;emailing the RDNC executive&lt;/a&gt; ( &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:RollerDerbyNationsCommittee@gmail.com"&gt;RollerDerbyNationsCommittee@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt; ), stating the legal (or commonly used, non-Derby) name, the current region they reside in, and the specific post they are being nominated for. You may nominate yourself, as well as being nominated by others.
The closing date for nominations is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;end of day, &lt;strong&gt;Sunday 20th October&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On close of nomination, nominees will all be offered the chance to decline their nomination, if they didn't self-nominate. If they accept, they will have a few days to prepare a statement of intent; and they will also be invited to the RDNC Podio group to be questioned by the National Representatives.
At the end of this process, the Nations will vote, via their Representatives, on each position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full details are available on the RDNC Facebook, here: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/RollerDerbyNationsCommittee/posts/2458998574382903"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/RollerDerbyNationsCommittee/posts/2458998574382903&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strongly encourage the community to engage with this process, as it really is essential to bring you the next World Cup in good time, and with the best interests of the Nations represented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>national teams</category><category>roller derby nations committee</category><category>roller derby world cup</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/10/RDNC-noms-171019/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 Oct 2019 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Derby Stance 2019</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/10/derbystance-2019/</link><dc:creator>SRD</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past three years, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rulefiftysix.com"&gt;Rule 56&lt;/a&gt; have been helping to drive and develop coaching in Roller Derby; both in terms of coaching itself, and also resources for developing those coaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt='The Derby Stance 2019 logo: 3 brown solid circles of increasing darkness overlapping left-to-right, with blue whistle inside the last. Text "Derby Stance Online Coaching Summit Nov 22-24 2019".' src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/10/DerbyStanceEvent.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very visible part of this has been their &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rulefiftysix.com/derby-stance"&gt;Derby Stance&lt;/a&gt; branded coaching community events; starting with a physical &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/10/03/uks-first-coaching-summit-derby-stance/"&gt;Coaching Summit&lt;/a&gt; back in &lt;em&gt;2016&lt;/em&gt;, and developing into a more extensive, and entirely virtual event in 2018 (2017 tested the concept with a series of individual webinars across the year). Holding the event online, with dedicated conference hosting services, was a response to the global nature of Roller Derby, and the global need for coaching resources and community; having to travel half-way across the world for a conference is not only expensive, but also wasteful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2018 Derby Stance was extremely successful, with attendees describing it with terms like "mind-blowing" and "by far the most helpful coaching training I’ve received in five years"!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Derby Stance Online Coaching Summit is returning for 2019, and Rule 56 have continued to build on and improve on what has been before. As the name suggests, this is, once more, a virtual-only event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with 2018's edition, individual "webinars" which make up the entire 3 day event, are separately bookable; you can buy tickets for just the sessions you're interested in. (If you're planning on attending a lot of the event, though, there's also whole-weekend tickets available, for a discount.).
In a change from last year, these are organised into two types: &lt;em&gt;"Seminars"&lt;/em&gt; (60 minute presentations, with time for questions) and &lt;em&gt;"Workshops"&lt;/em&gt; (90 minute interactive sessions led by the session leader; these are limited to &lt;em&gt;20&lt;/em&gt; attendees each).
(Regular attendees of EROC, the European Roller derby Organisational Conference, will recognise this division from there, where it is pretty effective at supporting different kinds of interaction.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's not all: just like a physical conference, the 2019 Derby Stance will have fringe and break-out events, organised as ad-hoc Facebook Live mini-streams. (Rule56 has already been trialing this with a series of "5 minutes with ..." events over the past year, and they work very well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike most physical conferences, a benefit of the virtual nature is that all Seminars (but not Workshops) will be available after the fact as recordings if you miss them; and simultaneous automated real-time transcriptions will be available during each session, including translated into a range of languages, to aid inclusion and understanding. (For those who can't attend at all, "watch-later" tickets will also be available to access all the content purely post-hoc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any Conference or Summit lives and dies by its roster of speakers, and this year's Derby Stance has a very exciting line-up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Rule 56 will be chairing &lt;em&gt;"Round Table"&lt;/em&gt; discussion sessions throughout the event, with topics decided dynamically as the Summit progresses; and the entire event will be introduced with a &lt;strong&gt;WFTDA Keynote Presentation&lt;/strong&gt; the day before the Summit itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets for both individual sessions, and the whole event, are &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rulefiftysix.com/derbystancetickets"&gt;on sale now&lt;/a&gt; . Advance sales for "watch later" tickets for Seminars are cheaper than they will be post-event; and remember that there are only 20 spots for each Workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derby Stance Online Coaching Summit 2019 will run from &lt;strong&gt;22 November 2019 to 24 November 2019&lt;/strong&gt; (with the keynote on the 21st).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Derby Stance would like to thank: WFTDA, Roller Dirty Soaps and Steaks Contact Wear for committing to sponsor this event, and help develop coaching resources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>coaching</category><category>derby stance</category><category>rule 56</category><category>webinar</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/10/derbystance-2019/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2019 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Fenix Roller Derby recap an exciting year for Patagonia.</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/09/fenix-patagonia-2019/</link><dc:creator>SRD</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/fenix_rollerderby/"&gt;FENIX Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; hosting the next big Patagonian event, a 2 day bootcamp coached by 2x4 Roller Derby's Tropical Mecánica, we asked them to recap the exciting history of the Patagonian community's past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antes de que&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/fenix_rollerderby/"&gt;FENIX Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;organizara el próximo gran evento patagónico, un campamento de entrenamiento de 2 días dirigido por Tropical Mecánica de 2x4 Roller Derby, les pedimos que recapitularan la emocionante historia de la comunidad patagónica el año pasado.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En general es importante destacar que el Derby patagónico ha crecido muchísimo estos años gracias al trabajo fuerte que ponemos cada equipo. Me refiero a estos tipos de eventos donde podemos compartir en casa entrenamiento con una destacada jugadora del Team OSOM [del 2x4], invitando a los equipos que puedan sumarse a participar también, así ellos y nosotros nos capacitamos para seguir creciendo. En la provincia de Santa Cruz hay 4 equipos que vivimos a 400 km de distancia entre nosotros, por lo tanto jugar seguido es muy difícil porque implica mucho gasto económico.
El año de Derby patagónico empezó con un torneo en Ushuaia que tuvo un excelente nivel y por suerte fénix roller Derby de fusionó con erráticas de Calafate en un equipo llamado cruz del sur y pudimos participar. Después tuvimos un bootcamp en caleta olivia una ciudad ubicada a 600 o 700 km de nuestro río Gallegos, pudimos participar también, finalizando el encuentro con un partido mixto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En cuanto a actividad de nosotros fueron los únicos eventos a los cuales pudimos asistir. Para el año que viene tenemos proyectados más viajes para participar a nivel nacional en torneos grandes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In general, it is important to highlight that Patagonian Derby has grown a lot in recent years thanks to the hard work that we put in from every team. I mean, these types of events where we can share bootcamps at home with an outstanding player from [2x4's] Team OSOM, inviting the teams that can Join to participate as well, so they and we are trained to continue growing. In the province of Santa Cruz, there are 4 teams that live 400 km away between us, therefore playing often is very difficult because it involves a lot of economic expense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This year of Patagonian Derby began with a tournament in Ushuaia that had an excellent level and, luckily, Phoenix Roller Derby merged with Calafate's Erráticas in a team called "Cruz del Sur" and we were able to participate. Then, we had a bootcamp in Caleta Olivia, a city located 600 or 700 km from our Rio Gallegos where we could also participate, ending the match with a mixed match.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As for our activity, they were the only events we could attend. For next year we have more trips planned to participate nationally in large tournaments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>argentine roller derby</category><category>fenix roller derby</category><category>patagonian roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/09/fenix-patagonia-2019/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2019 19:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>UKRDA needs you</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/09/UKRDANeedYou2019/</link><dc:creator>SRD</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's time for another guest post, as the UK's National Governing Body for Roller Derby, the UKRDA, have a message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roller Derby has changed a lot since the revival in 2001; with age, and with the changing of the wider cultures in which it’s embedded, it's grown, shrunk, formalised, organised, reorganised, liberated and moderated in various ways in various places. We’ve gone from being some friends who skate together and have fun to being a sport with World Cups and World Championships, leagues on six continents and a growing Junior reach (all whilst still having fun).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The UKRDA logo, on a folded banner." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/09/UKRDA-1.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UKRDA, like all of the Roller Derby “National Governing Bodies” has been part of that journey, but the role of National Governing Bodies hasn’t always been clear in our new and rapidly evolving sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2007, the group that would become UKRDA was nothing more than a Yahoo groups discussion board (some readers may not even remember that Yahoo ran such a service!); a place for the fifteen active leagues to coordinate, share advice, and work together to see how this Roller Derby thing could happen. Two years later, it had gone formal: naming itself the “United Kingdom Roller Derby Association”, to provide a democratic body that could represent the sport to all those structures that need an “organisation” to talk to. Slowly, as Roller Derby in the UK has grown, the UKRDA has evolved, taking on more responsibilities.
(To name a few: overseeing National Teams for the World Cups; supporting the development of British Championships; negotiating in a position of collective strength for insurance for leagues; managing grievances and complaints; upholding codes of conduct; standing up for leagues when they need support; supporting officials in development and training; and representing the sport to National and International media.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past month, it has taken another step, joining the German and Finnish NGBs in formalising a deeper relationship with the WFTDA. This collaboration may look like a simple letter, but the significance is so much more. In the face of other organisations, such as World Skate, who want to be seen as the leaders of roller derby, we say no. We acknowledge that this sport, our sport, is run by those that make it; the officials, the volunteers and the skaters. For this to continue to be the case, we have to put these procedures and agreements in place. These are important foundations, we're building a platform of NGBs working together with our global governing bodies - it's giving NGBs a clear voice in the future of our sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these significant changes and developments, the UKRDA continues to be a small team of volunteers. These volunteers are elected by member leagues and are governed by votes of those leagues. At times the UKRDA has been perceived as a "faceless bureaucracy", but in its simplest form, it is a group of volunteers who care deeply about the progression and development of Roller Derby. Our names are available on our website, we're real people who skate, volunteer and officiate at leagues across the UK. However, in the past year, online abuse and pressure have made the job even harder for this band of volunteers. We’ve heard more from people sending us abuse, than those wanting to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a crucial time for UK roller derby. The last 6 months, (or even 7 days!) have proved the value of clear, agreed on policies available for leagues as well as the importance of grievance and escalation processes. But we can’t do this alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have big plans. But we need more people to come on board to see these plans through. One of the priority projects for the UKRDA is to seek recognition from the Sports Councils across the UK as an NGB in our right - we can tap into structures, advice, support and potentially funding. We also need to review our grievance process to help ensure safe spaces. We want to foster the development and learning of officials through boot camps. We want to develop a UK wide safeguarding policy for roller derby that leagues can implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only so much a few people can do. You have the expertise of your sport, your leagues, your local areas. We need you to help us make all of these structures better, to support our sport and the people within it as well as we should. We're here being open and honest; the culture and actions towards URKDA need to change, and we need to change - this is where we need you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nominations for people to join the board of the UKRDA are open now. Without you, this won’t happen. We are only as strong as our member leagues and our volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have an Extraordinary General Meeting on &lt;strong&gt;October 3rd&lt;/strong&gt; - if your league is a member we want you to be there. All of us make up the UKRDA, but more of us need to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK roller derby scene is amazing. We are writing this while at British Championships playoffs, at the end of the first day when we have seen the level of commitment and skill from leagues that ten years ago would have been visible at a WFTDA D1 team. The athleticism, the energy, the passion is there.  We're so proud to be a part of this incredible sport, and we hope this has given you an insight into our commitment to its development, and that we have heard what our members want. This is a step towards achieving that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Flyer for #whyIchooserollerderby project, image of Banshees on track, overlaid with hashtag and instagram icons." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/09/Banshees-Copertina.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi everybody!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm Sugar Molotov from Banshees - Roller Derby Udine. We are a very small team in the rearmost region in north-east Italy and we are struggling to form a complete roster as many of us did or are still doing right now all around the world. We have all experienced the "roller what...?" reaction from people, and one day I thought: why is it so difficult to explain what's so exciting in this sport? How can I let them see and feel what I saw in Roller Derby and I'm feeling to this day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we decided to create a personal space on our social accounts (Facebook and Instagram) for every skater, ref, nso, or supporter to tell what they love about Derby and why they choose to play this amazing, thrilling and yet expensive and possibly dangerous sport, every day. We are all kind of very different people and still this brings us together in an unprecedented way, at least in my experience. This is how the &lt;em&gt;#whyIchooserollerderby&lt;/em&gt; campaign was born - of course we do not have as many followers as other, bigger teams would have, but we wanted to try it anyway!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, space is a very important concept in Roller Derby so we put no limit: I asked my teammates to join this project, choosing a photo and writing whatever they wanted about it. I wanted them to feel at ease to share what they felt comfortable to. On the way I thought that it would be nice to have other people joining it as well, and here I am asking if you'd feel like joining us. We don't have much to offer in return, except that we'll treasure every single contribution as if it was our own. Every text is translated in three languages, Italian as it's our nationality, English because we want as many people as possible to read it and Friulano, which is the language spoken in this specific, small region of Italy and  we want to take part in the effort to preserve it. It's part of our identity as well. Also, one of our teammate translated hers in spanish since it's her legacy, and we loved that immensely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So! I hope I've given you a reason to join our small project in the hope to make it count in spreading the news there's a new world here, and it's like anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the addresses of our pages, the campaign has just started of course, but you can see how it looks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for sparing some time for us,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sugar Molotov&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Mosaic image showing all of the profile pictures of contributors to the project, in grayscale, with central hue-based tone mapping from the Banshees logo." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/09/Banshees-mosaic.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: I wrote this letter when the campaign had barely started. It grew slowly but steadily and I really want to thank all the people who made an effort to keep it going: Enrico Comar and Mara Devincenti translated in friulano a few texts, but the majority were made by Enrico Gigante, whom we can’t thank enough. He’s always on the spot and faster than light! Thanks to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://arlef.it"&gt;ARLeF&lt;/a&gt;, the regional agency for friulano language and Francesca Battistutta from the regional counter for friulano language for the revisions. She also helped us a lot with this article and she’s invaluable to me for her cheerful self and  fierce friulano soul. All the graphics are made by Giulia Malaridotti (Woozy McWolf), our insomniac doggo-lover who send me edited pics at 3am in the morning so that I can publish them in time. English texts were reviewed by Chealsey Lynch (Marma Juke), our US blocker who’ll always be a Banshees in our hearts - we’ll miss you dearly. Special mention to my crazy fellow SMMs: Alessandra Menardi (Jackass Menny), Sveva Angelini (Freaky Pinball) and Alessandra Piermattei (Alycat), who believed in this project even when I didn’t and always had my back when I couldn’t keep up with the virtual world. Grrlz, you are simply the best. I could have never made this come true without you. Last but not least, the whole Banshees team who indulged in my whim and all the other fellow skaters and officials who took part in the project, sending us the most emotional, personal bits of their derby story. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

If you have something you want to say about Roller Derby, then we're happy to work with you to say it - as we have, for example, with Vendaval Roller Derby just this week. Vendaval contacted us to work on this article, and we thought that it was important enough to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next few weeks, we're hoping to have a few more guest articles - written entirely by others - as well some features and catchups on more exciting events across the world, returning to some of the national tournaments we covered last year, and some new events for this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we're always open for more articles: we'd like to help amplify the voices of the entire roller derby community, regardless of the language they speak, the country they're in, or the divisions they play in. So, please, get in touch with us, by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/scottish.rollerderby/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:scottishrollerderby@gmail.com"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/scottishrollerderby/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; message; or even WeChat (we can't link to WeChat directly) or WhatsApp. (We're thinking about a VK account, but don't have one yet.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>roller derby</category><category>we need you</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/09/WeNeedYou/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2019 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Guest Post: Saving RGA by Becoming KRD</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/06/savingrga_krd2019/</link><dc:creator>SRD</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recently, Kaiserslautern's Roller Girls of the Apocalypse underwent an extensive rebrand - not just the kind where you change a single noun, but a complete alteration of their league to "Kaiserslautern Roller Derby", along with a complete replacement of their league logo and colours!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have been lucky enough to persuade KRD's Public Relations Chair, Felicity Fleet, to write up their thoughts on the rebranding process - and what it means to the league for us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article has also been hand translated by KRD's Lena Albert into German [available by clicking the Deutsch link in the left pane under "Scottish Roller Derby Blog"]!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first roller derby boot camp as an assessed skater provided me with an understanding of the Roller Girls of the Apocalypse (RGA) brand in the wider European roller derby community. “Some years RGA is really good, and some years we wonder ‘what happened’?” a veteran German skater commented to me. This would become a familiar refrain as I began to travel and play with or against other teams. As a skater developed in RGA’s Fresh Meat program, I could easily answer “what happened”: A new skater with little experience, like me, replaced a veteran skater. And it’s no one’s fault. That’s what RGA is as a league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RGA is a German league in Kaiserslautern with membership primarily from the surrounding American military community. If you don’t know much about the U.S. military, here’s a quick debrief: U.S. military members generally stay in one place for 2-4 years before they are required to move for their job. In 2018, RGA lost 13 skaters or officials to military moves. By the end of 2019, 12 more players will have left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequence is that RGA serves as a great feeder league. We have sent well-trained skaters to top leagues in the USA, and we have trained a number of promising new skaters in our 6-month Fresh Meat program who are forced to take their potential elsewhere shortly after they pass assessments. During the years we see a large exodus of members, the role of our veteran players in the league changes from “valued player” to “valued trainer”. Our vets will spend most of their own training time helping newer members learn the game and gain skills, while losing their own ability to train at a higher level. Consequently, our veteran skaters play the next year or two at a lower competitive level than they are capable, since most of their teammates are new. Surrounding teams meet us on the track and ask “what happened?” to our level of play. Then the newer players become good players, the exodus begins, and the cycle continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we had to question if this is a sustainable model for our league. We had to have some hard conversations and genuine self-reflection as we considered our brand in the community and what it means to be competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
