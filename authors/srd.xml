With competitive Roller Derby on-pause, this presents a great opportunity to take stock and catch up with the state of the sport around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this vein, then, we're launching a new Vodcast series - hopefully a long-lived run of video chats with skaters around the world about derby in their country. As our opening episode, we caught up with 6 members of the Italian Roller Derby community to discuss the sport in their country, a new initiative for bringing the leagues together; and also to watch one of the 30-minute games from the 2018 Roller Derby World Cup - as Italy took on Team Indigenous!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can catch the Vodcast on YouTube here: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/DbMufElqL8c"&gt;https://youtu.be/DbMufElqL8c&lt;/a&gt;  and we'll be updating this with an audio-only version in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire Series Playlist is here, if you don't want to miss out on future episodes: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsfV1BOiVrnF5TiOOxaWE696A_59gz1sp"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsfV1BOiVrnF5TiOOxaWE696A_59gz1sp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Our apologies for the quality - this is a slightly rough first go, and we'll have better audio mixing in the next episode.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your region would like to be part of this project, please email us at &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:scottishrollerderby@gmail.com"&gt;scottishrollerderby@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt; to discuss - we'd love to hear from you (and help the world hear about you too)!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>anguanas</category><category>criminal bullets</category><category>harpies roller derby milano</category><category>italian roller derby</category><category>poison kittens</category><category>rdwc2018</category><category>roller derby world cup</category><category>team italy roller derby</category><category>vodcasts</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2020/03/Vodcasts-Italy/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Mar 2020 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>CaiRollers Need You</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2020/03/CaiRollersNeed/</link><dc:creator>SRD</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we reported earlier, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.cairollers.com"&gt;CaiRollers&lt;/a&gt; , Egypt's only Roller Derby league, recently made history by playing in South Africa, in the first ever African continental bout of Roller Derby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, whilst their tournament was one of the few not to be cancelled last weekend, events caught up with them rapidly, as the evolving pandemic led to many of the team having their flights back to Egypt cancelled. In addition, Egypt itself declared that it would soon be closing its borders, requiring other team members to rebook flights at short notice and considerable expense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an extremely stressful few days, we can confirm that all members of the CaiRollers have made it back to Cairo - some at the last moment, and many having to travel complex routes with changes in central Africa. However, all of this additional last-minute travel booking, and cancellation of other things planned in South Africa (with additional fees!), has cost the CaiRollers considerably. As well as the financial costs, they have also lost some of their kit enroute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, along with others like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://derbywithoutborders.org"&gt;Derby Without Borders&lt;/a&gt; , have been keeping in contact with the team to see how we can help them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you would like to help the CaiRollers, please donate funds to their PayPal account at fundraising@cairollers.com or contact Derby Without Borders who are also we believe helping to organise funds and support with replacement kit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>cairollers</category><category>covid19</category><category>egyptian roller derby</category><category>fundraising</category><category>international roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2020/03/CaiRollersNeed/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Mar 2020 15:40:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>COVID-19 and Roller Derby</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2020/03/COVID19/</link><dc:creator>SRD</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's hard not to be aware of the effect that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is causing on all human activity, globally, and Roller Derby is not exempt. COVID-19, the disease caused by
SARS-CoV-2, is stretching the health services of several nations. In order to control its spread, an increasing number of internal and external travel and gathering restrictions are being applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Italy and China, where all non-essential gatherings are currently banned, Roller Derby has stopped along with everything else. The Chinese leagues have not been able to practice since the lockdown in their
country in February (with restrictions now slowly being lifted); in Italy since the increasingly escalating actions in the last week or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An increasing number of tournaments are now beginning to cancel. In Italy, the Anguanas' March and April Sanctioned triple-headers have been cancelled; but even in countries with less internal restrictions, there are cancellations. Copenhagen Ladybugs have had to cancel their upcoming Sevens extravaganza due to the Danish advice, for example; and there are a host of cancellations across the continental USA, despite their government's lacklustre response to ongoing events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are yet to see changes to the status of the Men's Roller Derby World Cup or Rollercon, both highly-international events this year, but given the breaking news restrictions placed by the US President on travel from Schengen countries in Europe, it seems increasingly likely that there will be &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; knock-on effect. (They are both scheduled far enough in the future that it is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; that we could have a pandemic peak before they happen; but once an infectious disease goes pandemic, it becomes much harder to eradicate quickly.) [Edited after initial publication to note: MRDWC have announced that they will be following all local and international advice; but this has not yet resulted in an actual change to their schedule.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://resources.wftda.org/covid-19/"&gt;WFTDA&lt;/a&gt; has published risk-management guidelines for reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections if you do hold public games during this period. They essentially reduce to the usual advice that minimising physical contact, and maintaining proper hygiene standards is the most effective way to reduce the spread of the virus, along with recommendations to cancel non-essential events and follow your country's own guidelines and restrictions. (As with other examples of force majeure, WFTDA will not penalise members for cancelling Sanctioned events due to public health concerns around COVID-19.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're hoping to chat to some of the most affected regions and at least help keep their Roller Derby in the public eye a bit, even if they can't play...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...but if you want to help track all the effects on Roller Derby (or just see the results of this), we're linking to Axis of Stevil's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mZhFN7i7s1vTUCE5g0gfy_YqFNDaUq0sAvWhI0nT1so/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;public Google Doc&lt;/a&gt; for this purpose.

This is a very technical point,
as Newcastle's finest Roller Derby league have hosted EuroClash before - just under their previous name of Newcastle Roller Girls - but it's a good enough excuse for us to
write a quick lead in article...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year's EuroClash is just as international as previous years, but is running as a 1 day event at Newcastle's famous Walker Activity Dome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt='The EuroClash 2020 flyer image: EuroClash logo (text EUROCLASH 2020 and silhouette skater) with glass-shattering effect applied, the "WFTDA Recognised Tournament" logo, and additional glass shatter effects at the corners of the image.' src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2020/03/EuroClash2020.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 5 teams attending, and 5 games in total, this is a tournament in the looser sense of "a number of games in one place"; no overall winner will be decided. As with most WFTDA-Recognised tournaments,
the point is to make it easier for all the teams to achieve their WFTDA Sanctioned Games quota by having several at once (and also get to do that by playing interesting teams in a nice place).&lt;/p&gt;

We're happy with how this went, so we're going ahead with the same plan this year...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speedy Convalesce, one of the two primary Derby Scoreboard Developers, and founder of the Star Track "league without skaters" in Germany, has recalculated the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://stats.wftda.com/rankings?r=2986"&gt;ratings&lt;/a&gt; for every team in WFTDA - as if their rating was calculated at &lt;strong&gt;June 30th 2020&lt;/strong&gt; [the ranking which will be used to decide Qualifications and seedings into both WFTDA Playoffs, and the Continental Cups].. (Aficionados of the WFTDA rating will know that it applies a "decay factor" to older games, which is what we're tweaking here.) This helps to give a feel for how important the games each team has played in the season are, so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="All the locations with teams in our top 100 (larger stars mean more than one team is in the list in that location)" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2020/03/RoadToPlayoffs-100320.png"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;All the locations with teams in our top 100 (larger stars mean more than one team is in the list in that location)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst we can't predict the future, this will give the best guess of what teams need to do to qualify, based on what they've already done. This means that this will be the penultimate edition of the Road to Playoffs series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as attaining a minimum ranking, teams also need to play at least 4 bouts within the eligibility period (December 2019 to June 2029), and we'll be tracking their progress on this measure, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, though, we already have a very strong candidate, as Egypt's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cairollers.com"&gt;CaiRollers&lt;/a&gt; and South Africa's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goldencityrollers.com/"&gt;Golden City Rollers&lt;/a&gt; make history with the first every intra-African Roller Derby tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we've written about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/06/rollerderby-za-2019/"&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt;, South African roller derby exists in its own geographical bubble, far from other nations; but the CaiRollers have had almost as much trouble finding regular opponents (despite being just across the Mediterranean from Greece, and not that far from Italy and Austria). After making history with the first MENA game (against Abu Dhabi Roller Derby in January 2017), and playing Marseille's Bloody Skulls in mid 2017, the CaiRollers have had no other international opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The 'A Frican Good Time' Flyer, large text of the event name in block capitals over diagonally divided field of red (top left) and gold (bottom right). Red part of field has subtle ancient Egyptian hieroglyph pattern, gold part of field has subtle Zulu-style geometric patterning. To the left of the text is a jammer, whose flesh is invisible, but whose clothing and kit are red, black and gold." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2020/03/africangoodtimeflyer.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, since October 2018, they've been planning something more audacious: raising funds to travel themselves, down to Johannesburg. Readers will remember their &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cairollers-to-south-africa/#"&gt;Indiegogo&lt;/a&gt; fundraiser, which did not reach its target, to achieve this by 2019... but the funds that were raised there have been the basis of further money-raising within Cairo itself. Profits from local events, including a recent home teams game at the start of February, have all been funnelled into the venture, and individual skaters have spent personal funds on making their flight bookings. This will be the CaiRollers' first ever away bout, and it's a huge step to make in addition to the usual issues that come with playing away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has always been a collaborative effort between Golden City Rollers and the CaiRollers, but as GCR told us, it's grown since the initial plan of just a single game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"CaiRollers first contacted us with the idea for this event in October 2018, and we have literally been counting the days since! Last year, GCR and CaiRollers decided to run a tournament instead of just one game and we invited other South African leagues to participate. With travel costs being a challenge, Durban Roller Derby and Cape Town Rollergirls opted to form a mixed team, along with some players from UAE All Stars, where an ex-GCR-skater currently lives. They'll compete together as the Pan-African Rollers. It's been both challenging and exciting pulling together our first international tournament, but we've learned a lot along the way and we're hoping this will be the first of many more to come. Only days to go now...we can't wait to have all the teams here and on the track!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also makes this the first year that South Africa will host two tournaments with teams from across their own country: normally this happens just the once, in their end-of-year Derbyfest. As with Derbyfest last year, this will be a three-teams round-robin, followed by a "finals" playoff for the top two teams from that stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire tournament will be streamed on the GCR &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChpT56bZ-6bgrZL1slDXNVA"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; channel. (We'd keep an eye on GCR's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/228775404810943/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; event page for more info.)&lt;/p&gt;

So, whilst some Nationals - in, say Mexico or Sweden - have been running for a very long time - there's always new National tournaments forming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 1st of February, Denmark held its first &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/764179684037734/"&gt;National Tournament&lt;/a&gt; in 4 years, taking the unusual (worldwide) step of using the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rsdpDACXou9PL_wIZgPhZltHvF0ScWmlcyfhH6uWTC4/"&gt;Roller Derby Sevens&lt;/a&gt; ruleset.
This tournament was the result of both conception and huge commitment by one person - &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://aalborgrollerderby.dk/"&gt;Aalborg Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; 's MÃ¶xie CrÃ¼el, so we caught up with her to discuss the genesis of the tournament, it's aims and plans for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2010, PerÃº has hosted Roller Derby in the form of its only league, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/toxiclimarollerderby/"&gt;Toxic Lima Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; . We have been lucky enough to be able to talk to one of their longer-standing members, Twerkin Pony, about the history, and present, of Roller Derby in PerÃº.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst they might seem superficially different, Roller Derby and Role Playing Games have a surprising amount in common, including having experienced more than one resurgence of popular interest driven by pop cultural reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Roller Derby has &lt;em&gt;Whip It&lt;/em&gt;, and now &lt;em&gt;Birds of Prey&lt;/em&gt;; RPGs (and especially their most famous example, Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons), have appearances in &lt;em&gt;E.T.&lt;/em&gt; (and their own cartoon) in the 80s and &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; in the present day, as well as increasing popularity through âactual playâ, role playing game campaigns streamed live, or recorded, on Twitch, YouTube or as podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Libby Horacek has made the, perhaps obvious in retrospect, step of connecting the two, via an RPG set in the context of Roller Derby itselfâ¦ a game of tactics on track and management and feelings off track, which can only have one name:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://derbydrama.com"&gt;Derby Drama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="The Derby Drama kickstarter logo" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2020/02/derbydrama_original.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here at SRD we like both Roller Derby and RPGs, and we know that thereâs a huge crossover between D&amp;amp;D players and skaters, so we thought it was worth catching up with Libby to talk about all things Derby, RPGs and anything else, starting with how this all started for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the AWARDS page for the first ever SRDB Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ground-rules for the Awards are covered in the launch post &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/11/srdbawards-nom-2019/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in that link, voting was by &lt;em&gt;approval voting&lt;/em&gt;.
This means that you could, and should, tick boxes for all of the nominees you thought would deserve to win. You could tick all the boxes, if you thought they're all deserving; you could tick no boxes if you think none were deserving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get into the winners of each award, some statistics on the voting: we let you choose which categories to vote on, so some categories were voted on more than others.
In general, the categories with the longest list of nominees were the ones with the most votes, predictably; the category with the fewest votes &lt;strong&gt;BOOTCAMP&lt;/strong&gt; had about 7.5% of the votes cast on the category with the most, &lt;strong&gt;SKATER&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fraction of voters voting for more than one nominee varied significantly across the categories: with only two nominees, only 1 voter voted for both &lt;strong&gt;BOOTCAMP&lt;/strong&gt; nominees; whilst 38% of voters voted for more than one &lt;strong&gt;HALL OF FAME&lt;/strong&gt; nominee. Overall, (ignoring the &lt;strong&gt;RISING STAR&lt;/strong&gt; category as it had additional voting rules), 17% of votes were cast for multiple nominees, across the categories - this is a little higher than the average for this voting scheme in other deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also let you cast a vote for &lt;em&gt;no-one&lt;/em&gt;, if you didn't think any nominee deserved it in a category. Again, ignoring RISING STAR, only 4 such null votes were cast, around 0.2% of votes in total. This is a little lower than the average for systems which let you place null votes, which is encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that statistical interlude out of the way, lets get on with the main matter, the winners in each category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="awards"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AWARDS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="skater"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;SKATER&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Skater award had the largest number of votes of any category in the awards. Despite this, the clear winner, with more than 50% of the voters, was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ELO C RAPTOR&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;Harpies Roller Derby Milano&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="coach"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;COACH&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Coaching award was both popular (with more than 200 voters casting opinions), and very tightly contested, with the top 4 by votes all within 7 votes of each other. The winner, pipping the others to the post was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROSIE PEACOCK&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;New Wheeled Order&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Power of Scotland&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="referee"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;REFEREE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Referee award was also very popular, with more than 200 voters, but had a very clear margin for the winner (although still short of an overall majority)...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NICOLA'S RAGE&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;Crimson Vipers Roller Derby Bergamo&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="non-skating-official"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;NON-SKATING OFFICIAL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NSO award was not quite as heavily voted on, with more than 100 votes cast in total. The runaway winner, just 1% short of an overall majority, and with twice the votes of the next highest placed nominee...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KEDROG&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;Granite City Brawlers&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="announcer"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ANNOUNCER&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With only 3 nominees, the Announcer category had some interesting voting patterns... and a very clear winner. With a majority of the vote, the winning announcer was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRAEME MCPHAIL&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;Bairn City Rollers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="photographer"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;PHOTOGRAPHER&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Photographer category was the second most voted on category of all in the awards, with almost 250 votes cast in total. Despite this, it was also a very tightly contested category between the top 3, who remained within 10 votes of each other for the entire voting period (and changed position more than once).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the winning photographer was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VINCIANE PIÃRART&lt;/strong&gt; (NSP189)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="volunteer"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;VOLUNTEER&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Volunteer category, with only 3 candidates, was another with interesting patterns of voting. The overwhelming winner, with a supermajority of votes, was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUDREY&lt;/strong&gt; ... ex-Dundee Roller Derby, and sort of semi-retired volunteer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="league"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;LEAGUE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;League was another popular category, with more than 200 voters casting overall. It was also a very convincingly won category, with the margin between 1st and 2nd place being larger than the total votes cast for 2nd. Despite this, winning by a plurality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE ANGUANAS&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;Vicenza, Italy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tournament"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;TOURNAMENT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tournament category saw only just shy of 200 votes cast... and the overall winner had the support of a supermajority of those! It's...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SKATE IM RING 2019&lt;/strong&gt; hosted by &lt;strong&gt;Alp'n Rockets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="non-regulation-tournament"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;NON-REGULATION TOURNAMENT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Non-Regulation Tournament category should probably have been called the "Roller Derby Sevens" category, as all three candidates used that ruleset. This was a pretty tight contest between all three, with the winner by plurality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KRUSTFEST 2019&lt;/strong&gt; hosted independently, in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bootcamp"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;BOOTCAMP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With only two candidates this category went, convincingly, to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"LILY GASKELL AND FAIRY QUAKE'S BOOTCAMPS"&lt;/strong&gt; hosted by &lt;strong&gt;Rainy City Roller Derby&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="media"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;MEDIA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Media award was one of our less voted on categories, despite having a bunch of nominations, and the winning candidate changed over the course of voting... taking a win with a majority of voters when voting closed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The MRDA EUROPEAN QUALIFIERS LIVESTREAM&lt;/strong&gt; hosted on &lt;strong&gt;YouTube&lt;/strong&gt;, run with &lt;strong&gt;Granite City Brawlers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="hall-of-fame"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;HALL OF FAME&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hall of Fame category is something of a wildcard category, and had an eclectic range of nominees. This might explain why almost two-fifths of voters voted for more than one candidate in this category! Despite this, there was a clear winner, only just shy of an overall majority...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first Hall of Fame member is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5TH BLOCKER SKATES&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Glasgow&lt;/strong&gt;'s own Roller Derby shop!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rising-star"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;RISING STAR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we come to the Rising Star category, for junior skaters, or up-and-coming younger skaters in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to some anomalies in the nomination process, and also to especially encourage voters in this category to vote on the basis of deserving, rather than just popularity, this category required you to vote for 2 or more nominees. (Votes for a single nominee were considered the same as a vote for no-one.) Despite this being clearly described on both the Nominees page, and on the actual voting form (in two places on the latter), a number of voters still voted for a single candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, including these single votes would not have changed the overall winner (although it would change the margin of win, and the ordering of all the other positions). The Winner, with a significant margin in terms of valid votes, was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;red OWEch (Owen Squires)&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;Newcastle Junior Roller Derby (Australia)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst there's no official prize for winning an SRDB Award (and we consider being Nominated to be the real point), we'd be happy to work with any of the winners on a "Winners Profile" to be published later in the month or year. Please get in touch with us if you are a winner (or the nominee of a winner) if you want to work with us on this!&lt;/p&gt;
